The Artuqid dynasty (Artuklu in Turkish, sometimes also spelled as Artukid or Ortokid; Turkish plural: Artuko?ullar?) was an Oghuz Turkish dynasty that ruled in Eastern Anatolia and Northern Iraq in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Two main branches of the dynasty ruled from Hasankeyf (H?sn-? Keyf, H?snkeyfa) between 1102?1231 and Mardin between 1106?1186 (and until 1409 as vassals). There was also a third branch that acquired Harput in 1112 and was independent between 1185?1233.  The dynasty was founded by Artuq, son of Eksï¿½k, a general originally under Malik Shah I and then under the Seljuk emir of Damascus, Tutush I. Tutush appointed Artuq governor of Jerusalem in 1086. Artuq died in 1091, and his sons Sokman and Ilghazi were expelled from Jerusalem by the Fatimid vizier al-Afdal Shahanshah in 1098; the Fatimids lost the city to the crusaders the following year..
