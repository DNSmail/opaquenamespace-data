Ming dynasty (b Jinjiang District, Fujian Province, 1570; d April/May ?1641). Chinese calligrapher, painter and poet. He received his jinshi degree in 1607, eventually becoming Grand Secretary in 1626. In 1629 Zhang was implicated in the crimes of the corrupt eunuch Wei Zhongxian, and was stripped of his ranks and sent home a commoner. This has affected his standing as an artist, for despite a manifest talent, he was either ignored or vilified by Chinese art historians. Research in the 20th century has absolved him of collusion, however, and his artistic standing has been restored. Although little appreciated at home, Zhang was recognized during his lifetime by the Japanese, owing to the particular relationship of the Japanese at that time with the province of Fujian, where Zhang retired. Chinese Chan (Jap. Zen) Buddhist monks from Mt Huangbi (Jap. ?baku), Fujian, were exporting their sect to Japan and training monks to be sent there. Zhang had by this time become a Chan Buddhist, as one of his seals and his writings attest. There are large numbers of Zhang?s works in Japanese collections, thanks partly to the presence of his daughter in Osaka and partly to the monks, who imported his calligraphy. Zhang is usually classified as one of the four masters of late Ming (1368?1644) calligraphy, with Xing Tong (1551?1612), Mi Wanzhong (1570?1628) and Dong Qichang. Most of his writing is in running script (xingshu), cursive script (caoshu) and small regular script (xiao kaishu). The models he followed in early years were Wang Xizhi, Sun Guoting and Su Shi; Dong Qichang was another influence. His large calligraphy is closer to his more eccentric juniors Wang Duo (1592? 1652) and Fu Shan. Wang and Fu based their exaggerations on specific Western Jin-period (ad 265? 316) sources, however; Zhang?s style emerged from his own imagination. In a poem by Li Bai (ad ? 701?62) in linked cursive script (see 1977 exh. cat., no. 62), Zhang wields a slanted brush to produce simple, taut, unadorned and angular lines, closely and continuously woven in the columns but separated by wide spaces. Pressure within a character is generally uniform; contrast is produced between words lightly and thinly brushed and those more heavily written. Followed on the left by the sensitive lines of his signature, the whole produces an impression of stability and finesse. Zhang was also a competent landscapist. Biographers mention Huang Gongwang as his model; the paintings themselves are in typical late Ming literati style clearly influenced by Dong Qichang. He was an able poet, particularly fond of Tao Yuanming (ad 365?427) and Bai Juyi (ad 772?846), and much of his calligraphy is his own poetry. --DOA"@en .
