Ming dynasty (b Changzhou [modern Suzhou], Jiangsu Province; fl c. 1594?1640). Chinese painter. Little is known about the life of Sheng Maoye: literary sources describe only his painting style, and he provided no personal information in inscriptions on his paintings. There is no record of his having pursued an official career, no family history and no surviving contemporary criticism of his skills. This implies that he did not move in Suzhou literati circles, since painters firmly established in the scholar?amateur ï¿½lite, such as Dong Qichang, are generally well documented. Indeed, Sheng?s paintings are ?functional? rather than in the literati style (see China, ï¿½V, 4(ii)); many are large hanging scrolls depicting groups of scholars in nature, intended for hanging in entrance and reception halls, and some are ?occasional? paintings commissioned for special events. It seems that Sheng made his living by painting, but to dismiss him as a ?professional?, implying vacuous imitation and lack of originality, is to undervalue him. Sheng?s dated paintings belong to the period 1594?1640. He was one of the leading Suzhou masters of his day, although his range of subject-matter was narrower than that of such others as Li Shida and the more highly regarded Zhang Hong. The scrolls Scholars Gazing at a Waterfall (1630; Berlin, Mus. Ostasiat. Kst) and Strolling in Spring Mountains (1623; Takatsuki, Sueyoshi Hashimoto priv. col.) exemplify the salient features of Sheng?s large-scale ?scholar-in- landscape? themes. In the former, varied angles, tonal depth and texture create contrasts between the three elements of trees, earth masses and figure groups. Pines and cypresses are broadly outlined, densely textured configurations consisting of exposed roots, dark masses of foliage and contorted, spindly branches. Among the leafless projecting branches there are dark accents in short strokes that seem to leap from the silk with a brusqueness similar to that of Sheng?s calligraphy. Earth forms are less jarring but no more stable. Strolling in Spring Mountains represents a similar, though more exaggerated landscape. The figures in Sheng?s landscapes, which seem only vaguely conscious of the precariousness of their environment, are of a certain type: They tend to be of ample proportion and to wear heavy, full garments which increase their rotundity. Their rather portly physiques are further emphasized by the artist?s inclination to ignore the interior folds of garments and instead to concentrate upon defining the overlapping folds of cuffs, collars and hems with wide, wavering lines (DMB). The ?scholar-in-landscape? theme was a standard one in the professional repertory and was also used by such amateurs as Wen Zhengming, although generally the figures are smaller and not the focus of the scene. An undated album of eight leaves (see fig.) is among Sheng?s best works. On the basis of style, it appears to have been executed in the 1620s, when Sheng made greater use of atmospheric effects. The landscape, bathed in mist, includes figures boating or fishing, on bridges or banks, rendered with a few descriptive strokes. Houses are likewise reduced to outlines with minimal indications of thatched or gabled roofs. Hills and banks, rather than being constructed from distinct units and repetitive texture strokes (cun), are defined by successive layers of washes and irregular dots: the palest tones were applied first, and the darkest areas occur as blurred patches of foliage or the dry contours of rock faces. Although there are allusions to the past (one leaf recalls illustrations of Su Shi?s poem Chibi fu (?Ode on the Red Cliff?), and certain simple elements are close to the style of Dai Jin, the album represents Sheng at his most original. Sheng?s frequent use of far-off mist and vapour, into which the elements of the landscape appear to dissolve, may seem to be intended to avoid the requirements of careful composition and to result in shallow poetic effects. The technique has two practical purposes, however: first, in combination with the darker tones of rocks and middle-ground and foreground trees, mist gives a sense of spatial depth; and second, the viewer is prompted to concentrate on areas of greater definition, approximating the optical experience by which focusing on certain areas means the surrounding environment is perceived as blurred or less distinct. --DOA"@en .
