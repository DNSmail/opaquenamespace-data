Yuan dynasty (b Qinglongzhen [now Qingpu, Songjiang, Shanghai Municipality], 1255; d 1328). Chinese painter. Under the Yuan dynasty (1279?1368) he became an official, rising to the level of Vice-President of the River Conservation Bureau. He was famous for his paintings of horses (see fig.), which were much admired by both his Mongol and Chinese patrons. In horse painting he followed in the tradition of the Song-period (960?1279) artist Li gonglin, which was characterized by use of the ?iron-wire? line and a minimum of shading. Ultimately, however, Ren?s style can be traced to the Tang (ad 618?907) painters Yan Liben and Han Gan. Ren?s earliest surviving painting is dated 1280, indicating that he was a mature artist by his mid-twenties. Although he worked as an official under the alien Mongol emperors, he was capable of paintings that incorporated clear political messages. The most famous is Fat and Lean Horses (Beijing, Pal. Mus.), in which, according to his inscription, the fat horse represents the self- satisfied, wealthy official and the lean one the humble, poor, self-deprecating official. Most extant works by Ren are depictions of horses, but Two Ducks on an Autumn River (Shanghai Mus.) indicates that he was also accomplished in the bird-and-flower (huaniao) genre. This work suggests Ren?s use of the style of the 10th-century painter Huang Quan (see Xu Bangda). Ren?s abilities as a figure painter are demonstrated in the superb handscroll, the Daoist Immortal Zhang Guolao in Audience with Tang Minghuang (Beijing, Pal. Mus.). Ren had several talented followers, including his son, Ren Zizhao, and grandson, Ren Bowen. The latter is represented by one surviving work, the brilliant handscroll, Tribute Bearers (San Francisco, Asian A. Mus.). A colophon on this scroll by Wen Zhengming suggests that the model may have been a work by Yan Liben or Qian Xuan. Ren Renfa?s tomb was discovered in Qingpu in the 1950s. --DOA"@en .
