Modern (b Neijiang, Sichuan Province, 10 May 1899; d Taipei, 2 April 1983). Chinese painter, calligrapher, collector and forger. From an artistic family, he began to paint under the tutelage of his mother, Ceng Yi, and did his first paid painting for the local fortune-teller when he was 12 years old. Zhang?s elder sister gave him his first lessons in the classics. At 15 he embarked on three years of schooling at the Qiujing Academy in Chongqing. In 1917 he went to Kyoto in Japan to join his elder brother Zhang Shanzi (1882?1940). Here, Daqian learnt the art of textile painting, and the brothers collaborated in painting tigers: Shanzi painted the animals and Daqian the surroundings. Shanzi kept a pet tiger in the house, using it as his artistic model. In 1919 Zhang returned to China, where he continued his studies in Shanghai with the scholar Ceng Xi. He also studied with the artist Li Ruiqing (1867?1920) and was exposed to Li?s calligraphy in seal script (zhuanshu), based on models of the Zhou to Wei periods (c. 1050 bc? ad 265), as well as running script (xingshu) and regular script (kaishu). Although Zhang was not primarily a calligrapher, he developed his own personal style: his characters are intentionally splayed and awkward and elements within a character lean in unexpected directions. During his time in Shanghai, Zhang entered a Buddhist temple in Songjiang and only then received the name Daqian. However, after three months he left monastic life and went home to Sichuan Province, where he was married. Zhang remained in Sichuan until the death of his father in 1925. During this period he concentrated on the painters Zhu Da and Daoji, discovering a particular affinity with the latter. He was able to imitate these painters so effectively that he could add forged seals and signatures to paintings and fool experienced connoisseurs. Such imitative paintings by Zhang may still be circulating unacknowledged among art collectors, and there is no doubt that various major museums own Chinese ?old masters? that were, in fact, painted by Zhang. Other artists whom Zhang copied range from the 10th-century Dong Yuan and Juran to the 13th- and 14th-century artists Ni Zan and Huang Gongwang. In 1929 Zhang joined the selection committee for the first National Exhibition of Fine Arts in Nanjing and two years later, with his brother Shanzi, accompanied an exhibition of early Chinese paintings to Tokyo. In 1933 he exhibited his works abroad for the first time at the Musï¿½e du Jeu de Paume in Paris and attracted the notice of foreign critics. The following year he exhibited in China at Beiping (Beijing) and Nanjing. By 1936 he was teaching at the National Central University in Nanjing under the painter Xu Beihong. In 1940 Zhang organized a group to travel to Dunhuang in Gansu Province and copy the Buddhist wall paintings. In two and a half years they completed over 200 paintings, which were exhibited in 1944 in Chengdu and Chongqing. Consequently, religious motifs executed in fine outline and filled with coloured wash became a staple of Zhang?s painting. By this time, Zhang had begun to work with the theme of the lotus. He painted lotuses from every angle, at every stage of growth, in formats ranging from small to monumental. His lotus paintings frequently feature expanses of pitch-black ink wash, which contrast starkly with the white paper beneath, and flashes of brilliant colour swirling to the surface at a point of focus (see fig.). The running colours of his lotus paintings perhaps inspired his distinctive imaginative landscapes. In these, bold panels of ink are laid on a wet page and spread to form natural patterns; sometimes a brilliant turquoise and inky black are juxtaposed, and sometimes an intense colour merges with the naked page. Blank spaces become waterfalls or rising clouds, the outlines of roofs suggest peaks, or a bridge over a curved space intimates a path. As simple washes these paintings would be considered abstract, but by adding a few strokes Zhang placed them in the tradition of Chinese landscape painting. In 1945 Zhang exhibited his works in Chengdu and was included in a UNESCO show of contemporary art that travelled to Paris, London, Prague and Geneva. From then on he exhibited every year, frequently abroad. From 1950 to 1952 he and his family visited India, where he studied the Ajanta cave paintings. In 1952 he moved to Argentina, and two years later to Brazil. Always unconventional, with his archaic Chinese dress and old-fashioned wispy beard, wherever he travelled he was accompanied by a retinue of exotic beasts and a gourmet chef, and wherever he settled he built a Chinese garden. By 1960 Zhang?s works were well known in Paris and had travelled to most other European capitals. In the 1960s he began to exhibit more frequently in Hong Kong and had the first of many exhibitions in Southeast Asia. In 1967 he had his first of many shows at the National Museum of History in Taipei. By 1980 he had re-established contact with mainland China, although no exhibitions of his works were held there until after his death. --DOA"@en .
