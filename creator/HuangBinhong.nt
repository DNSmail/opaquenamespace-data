Modern (b Jinhua, Zhejiang Province, 1864; d Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, 1955). Chinese painter. He was the modern embodiment of the literati ideal. Huang and his contemporary Qi Baishi became known by the sobriquets Huang of the South and Qi of the North. Originally educated as a scholar?official, Huang failed the civil service examination several times. After briefly managing his ancestral estate in Shexian, Anhui Province (1901?7), he embarked on a long career of teaching, editing art books and periodicals, collecting (and occasionally dealing in) works of art, writing and painting. Huang?s works of scholarship included treatises (published 1940?42) on three artists of the late Ming (1368?1644) and early Qing (1644?1911) periods: Hongren, Kuncan and Cheng Sui (c. 1605?91); these laid the foundations for later fruitful study. His book Huang shan huayuan lï¿½e (?An account of the Mt Huang school of painting?) is an indispensable guide to the Anhui school of painting. Meishu congshu (?Encyclopedia of Chinese fine art?; 20 vols), a compendium of art books first published in 1911, which Huang co-edited with Deng Shi (d c. 1948), is still used by scholars. Stylistically, the paintings of Huang Binhong can be divided into four periods. In the first, up to the age of 50, the artist devoted himself to learning from both ancient and contemporary masters. In the second period, between the ages of 50 and 70, Huang travelled widely, increasing his knowledge of real landscapes. In the third, from the ages of 70 to 85, he began to establish a distinctly personal style. When he was 80 he held his first and only one-man show in Shanghai. He continued to paint until shortly before his death; during this last period his style underwent a virtual metamorphosis. Huang took a humanistic view of a painter?s role. Echoing Dong Qichang, he wrote that it is a fundamental requirement of art that the technique and skill of the artist, when he paints mountains and rivers, be invisible; consequently, these subjects, as a result of the painter?s act of creation, assume a mysterious quality that cannot be found in nature. One of the most salient aspects of Huang Binhong?s work was the intimate relationship between calligraphy and painting that permeated both his aesthetic theory and his practice. Huang believed that brushwork must be cultivated by means of a constant study of inscriptions on ancient bronzes and stelae (see China, ï¿½IV, 2(viii)) and of rubbings made from these, of examples of calligraphy and even of literature. From his lifelong study of epigraphy and seal-engraving, Huang arrived at a number of principles to underpin his pictorial composition, the most important of which was to achieve ?void? (xu) in solid form (shi). Calligraphy not only suggested but embodied the inner workings of nature. Painting, like calligraphy, should accomplish ?order within disorder?, ?the regularity of irregularity? and ?the resemblance of non-resemblance?. Huang also drew an analogy between composing a painting and playing a game of chess, in which the player must be constantly aware not only of the moves already made but also of those that may yet be made. Huang constantly experimented with different ways of applying ink wash, which, when combined with his brushwork, helped him to achieve the strong stylistic effects he called hunhou huazi (?solidity and density in structure, and freshness and moisture in ink and brushwork?); an example can be seen in the handscroll Lake and Mountains Before Rain (1952; Hong Kong, Chiu Chu Tung priv. col., see 1989?90 exh. cat., p. 34, fig. 13). The album Insects and Flowers (see fig.) is an excellent example of Huang?s brushwork, which, though strong, is apparently childlike and thus embodies the literati ideal of zhuo (?intentional awkwardness?). The fact that at least five types of brushwork, seven ways of applying ink and nine methods of manipulating water can be distinguished in his late work reflects Huang?s sophisticated technical mastery. Indeed, the innovative use of water is one of Huang?s most important contributions to 20th-century Chinese painting. In an undated album leaf depicting a landscape (336ï¿½349 mm; Hong Kong, Tao Ho priv. col., see 1989?90 exh. cat., p. 71, pl. 18D), the blending of water, ink and colour is masterful. For the last two years of his life Huang Binhong was almost completely blind. To compensate, he relied increasingly on the intuitive use of ink and brushwork acquired through a lifetime of practice, combining his tempestuous, rough brushwork with layer upon layer of ink washes. At first glance, his late paintings appear disorderly. On close inspection, however, these works reveal a rich and complex visual structure and the supramundane quality that he always sought in landscape painting. --DOA"@en .
