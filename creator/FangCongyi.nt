Yuan dynasty (b Guixi, Jiangxi Province; fl c. 1340?80). Chinese painter who became a Daoist priest in his youth; he joined the Zhengyi sect, whose main temples were situated in the Shangqing Temple (Shangqing si) on Mt Longhu in his home district, and studied under the priest Jin Pengtou. During the early 1340s, after the death of his teacher, he travelled from Xinzhou to many areas along the River Yangzi and in 1343 visited the capital, Dadu (Khanbaligh, now Beijing), where he became acquainted with many officials and scholarly men and established a reputation as a painter. He is reported to have visited many famous sites along the Great Wall and may have made several trips to the scenic mountains that were considered the home of the Daoist immortals; these included the Taihang range, on the border of Henan and Shanxi provinces, Mt Heng (Shanxi), Mt Tai and Mt Huafouju (Shandong), Mt Zhong in Nanjing (Jiangsu), Mt Kuanglu (Jiangxi) and Mt Wuyi (Fujian). During his time in the capital he seems to have attracted the attention of the Princess of Lu, known as a great patron of art, and of another Daoist painter, Zhang Yanfu ( fl 1340?50), who was connected with the court. However, he soon returned to Xinzhou and set up his own temple. Later he was said to have lived in mountain temples in Jinhua, in western Zhejiang Province. During the last period of his life he is thought to have travelled extensively in south China, including various parts of Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, visiting many of the Daoist sacred mountains. According to his contemporaries, he had an unearthly manner and bearing that recalled the qualities of a Daoist immortal. This characteristic ethereality is reflected in such paintings as Boating under Mt Wuyi (hanging scroll, 1359; Beijing, Pal. Mus.) and Divine Mountains and Luminous Woods (hanging scroll, 1365; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.), in which the landscape appears to change and evolve, without clearly defined shapes and images. Influenced by the atmospheric monochrome ink-wash manner of Mi Fu and Mi Youren of the Song period (960?1279), his paintings may be grouped, with those of Ni Zan, in the untrammelled category ( yipin) of painters (see China, ï¿½V, 5(ii)). Fang was also part of the tradition developed in the early Yuan period (1279?1368), when literati painters such as Gao Kegong were increasingly concerned with developing personal modes of expression and with the depiction of more than objective reality (e.g. Clouds and Snow on the Shanyin Mountains, after Gao Kegong, hanging scroll, n.d.; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.). However, his life as a Daoist priest and the individuality of his style set him apart from his contemporaries.--DOA"@en .
