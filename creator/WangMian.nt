Yuan dynasty (b Zhuji, Shaoxing District, Zhejiang Province; d Kuaiji, in modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province, 1359). Chinese poet and painter. He was the most influential master in the later momei (?ink-plum?) tradition and the only early plum specialist with a substantial surviving oeuvre. Born into a modest family of the gentry, Wang, like many southern Chinese scholars under the Mongol Yuan dynasty (1279?1368), was thwarted in his ambition to enter official life. He became an eccentric itinerant, winning recognition as a scholar, poet and painter but failing to obtain sustained private or political patronage. He depended on painting plum blossoms for his living. In 1348, on returning south from the capital Dadu (modern Beijing), he predicted chaos and withdrew to Mt Jiuli. In 1359, shortly before his death, he emerged from seclusion to offer strategic advice to the rebel forces of Zhu Yuanzhang; Zhu later became the emperor Taizu (reg 1368?98), first ruler of the Ming dynasty (1368?1644). A problematic figure in his own time, Wang was idealized by later scholars; he remains best known for his fictional role as a paragon of virtue in the 18th-century novel Rulin waishi (?The scholars?). Wang was the pivotal figure in the development of the momei genre from classical Song (960?1279) practice to the later tradition that has endured into modern times (see China, ?V, 3(vi)(c)). He created stylized plum branches with sweeping horizontal or vertical S-curves framing poetic inscriptions, as for example Ink Plum (New Haven, CT, Yale U. A. G.; see China, fig. 125). By joining pictorial and written elements in formal and expressive unity, he extended the subtlety and range of the genre and established its characteristic form. Wang?s large hanging scrolls feature new heroic images of massive, battered old trees with soaring young branches in full bloom. Because of traditional associations of plum blossoms with endurance and simplicity, and in conjunction with Wang?s vivid personality, such images became an emblem of integrity and survival in adversity. Wang?s works became the definitive stylistic and iconographic model for later momei painting, and his life inspired other scholar-painters who had to turn their literati accomplishments into their means of subsistence. Wang?s paintings survive in collections in Asia and the USA, including the Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland, OH; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Shanghai Museum; the National Palace Museum, Taipei; the Palace Museum, Beijing; and the Imperial Household Collection, Tokyo. His poetry is collected in his Zhu zhai shiji (?Poetry collection of the Bamboo Studio?). --DOA"@en .
