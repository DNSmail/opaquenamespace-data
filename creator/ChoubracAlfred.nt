Alfred Choubrac (1853-1902) was one of the handful of posterists who gained prominence before the Golden Nineties. Educated in classic art at the Ecole des Beaux- Arts in his native Paris, he started out as a painter of military scenes in collaboration with his brother, Leon. To make a living, he did caricatures and illustrations for 'Gil Blas,' 'L'Echo de Paris,' 'Le Courrier Fran?ais' and some other paper; later, he became a scene designer for theaters at which he was very successful. In the early 1889s, Chroubac joined the fledgling group of poster designers: in 1884, when Maindron published the first article on the subject, he listed only nine active posterists known to him, and in the first poster exhibition, held that same year in the Passage Vivienne in Paris, only three of them were represented: Jules Ch?ret and the two Choubrac brothers."@en .
