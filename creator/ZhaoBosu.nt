Song dynasty Zhao Boju and his younger brother, Zhao Bosu, also a painter, were 7th-generation descendants of the founder of the Song dynasty (960?1279), Emperor Taizu (reg 960?75). The Zhao brothers reportedly believed that ?each artist ought to have his own sense of style within his breast, so that his spirit emerges spontaneously, and the work will exude a taste that is pure, refined and remote, unbounded by the formal conditions of the objects.? This is in keeping with the literati belittlement of physical verisimilitude and stress on the supremacy of expression, according to which a painter should attempt to capture the inner essence of the subject more than its outer form. Although the Zhao brothers were not members of the Imperial Painting Academy, they were pre- eminent in Southern Song painting circles, excelling in coloured (qinglï¿½) landscapes (usually associated with the Northern school) and figure painting. --DOA"@en .
