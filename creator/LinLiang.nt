Ming dynasty (b Nanhai, Guangdong Province, c. 1416; d c. 1480). Chinese painter. He became a provincial administrator and was referred to the court during the reign of the Tianshun emperor (1457?64). He was later promoted to the Imperial Guard under the system of titles given to court painters in the early Ming period (1368?1644). His surviving works feature large subjects in monochrome ink, although he is recorded as having also been proficient in colours. He has been seen as chiefly influenced by Bian Wenjin (c. 1400?40), with whom he painted Cranes (hanging scroll, ink on silk, 1.74ï¿½0.87 m; Guangzhou, Guangdong Prov. Mus.). He is thought of as one of the foremost protagonists of the Zhe school, painting boldly in ink on silk, with no more than a signature inscribed on his works. Lin Liang also painted magpies, peacocks, pheasants and magnificent eagles, many of them almost filling his hanging scrolls. Birds Assembling in a Thicket (handscroll, ink on paper, 0.34ï¿½12.11 m; Beijing, Pal. Mus.) is the finest example of Lin Liang?s lively brushwork. The composition begins with sparrows flying towards the upper branches of a flowering plum in which orioles are singing, then moves deep into the midst of the thicket. Bamboo and a venerable pine dominate in the left half of the scroll, with a final bankside section depicting wading birds beneath rushes. Over 70 birds are shown in all attitudes, from sparrows and kingfishers to a single eagle in the branches of the pine tree. Geese and Reeds (hanging scroll, ink on silk, 1.88ï¿½0.99 m; London, BM) exemplifies his work in ink and wash on silk. It shows four geese in the foreground by a swiftly flowing stream. In the stream are small boulders or rocks edged with thick black ink; reeds grow in a dense tangle with a few blades of long grass on the bank, obscuring the view into the middle and far distance. Since the focus is on the foreground, the subjects are large?the two geese in the front are close to full size?yet the painting is not cluttered, owing to the unifying effect of the ink washes and lines. --DOA"@en .
