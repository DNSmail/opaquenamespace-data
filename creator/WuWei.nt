Ming dynasty (b Wuchang, Hubei Province, 1459; d 1508). Chinese painter. Wu was born into a family of scholar-officials. His father, who took the provincial-level civil-service degree to become a juren, was interested in alchemy and collected paintings and calligraphy. However, when Wu was still young, his father?s dissolute life-style and then death resulted in family ruin. Wu was brought up by a provincial official; at the age of 17 he travelled to the southern capital, Nanjing, hoping to establish himself as a painter. Early adverse circumstances meant that Wu had little hope of entering official service; instead, through the friendship and patronage of influential people, and in spite of being self-taught, he rose on the merits of his artistic abilities to a position at the court of the Chenghua emperor (reg 1465?87). In the Jiangnan region (south China) he met a tutor of the heir-apparent named Chu, who held the hereditary title Duke of Chengguo. Chu found work for Wu and gave him the sobriquet, or hao, Xiaoxian, (?Small Immortal?). Shortly before the death of the Chenghua emperor in 1488, Wu was invited to the main capital at Beijing and honoured with the title daizhao (painter in attendance) in the Renzhi Dian (Palace of Virtue and Knowledge), as well as a low- ranking honorary official post. He was also awarded a seal that read ?foremost among painters?. According to anecdote, Chenghua once summoned Wu to paint a scene of pine trees in a wind. Wu arrived in the imperial presence drunk, supported by two servants, but nonetheless proceeded to spill ink onto a screen on the floor and, by rubbing and smearing, to create so powerful an illusion of wind and clouds that the servants grew pale with fear; Chenghua reportedly pronounced Wu?s work to be that of an immortal. When his service ended Wu returned to Nanjing, where he gained a reputation for licentiousness and heavy drinking. Under the Hongzhi emperor (reg 1488?1505) he was recalled to court, but was soon granted leave to return to Wuchang to ?sweep the ancestral tombs?. The next imperial summons was accompanied by the gift of a house in a fashionable section of Beijing. However, Wu remained only two years before relocating to Nanjing. In 1508, under the Zhengde emperor (reg 1506?21), the painter received his final summons to the capital; he died while preparing for the journey, apparently from the effects of drink. Wu is said to have had four wives and at least four children. Wu was an eccentric painter in the manner of Gu Kaizhi and Wu Daozi. His erratic behaviour, combined with a swift, sure technique, identifies him with the longstanding tradition in Chinese painting of the ?untrammelled? genius, whose nonconformity adds to his charm and reputation. In artistic style he was versatile (sometimes considered a defect), equally adept at disciplined, plain-line (baimiao) painting and at the rough ?scribbly? manner used in many paintings of Chan Buddhist or Daoist subjects. In landscape painting he was influenced by Dai jin and is consequently classed as a Zhe school artist. Few of Wu?s surviving paintings are dated, but it is likely that his Dai Jin-flavoured landscapes are from the early part of his career. Other landscapes with figures are possibly later, featuring looser, more rapid and flowing brushwork and emphasizing a kinaesthetic dimension rather than careful delineation of form. His most impressive landscape, painted in fast-running brushwork, is Myriad Miles of the Long River (1505; Beijing, Pal. Mus.) Wu?s versatility is perhaps most marked in his figure paintings. The hanging scroll Two Daoist Immortals (Shanghai Mus.) represents what is commonly known as the artist?s ?rough? style, relying for animation and intensity upon the muscular tension of the figures? poses, a nervous handling of drapery and variations in thickness of the rapid brushline. At the other extreme is the plain-line drawing (baimiao) manner, conveying a sense of mass and space, employed by both professional and amateur artists after the 11th-century painter Li Gonglin. Lady Carrying a Pipa (see fig.) represents a mixture of the two styles that possibly originated with Wu. It is not true plain-line drawing since it lacks control and precision, and there are areas of light ink wash. It does, however, retain a sense of refinement unusual in rough works. While the exact subject is uncertain, the melancholy figure, presented in profile and carrying a pipa (Chinese lute) in a brocade bag over her shoulder, recalls Zhao Wuniang, the heroine of the mid-14th- century play Lute Song, who journeyed to the capital in search of her lover. If such a reference is intended, the attempt to incorporate the energizing effect of a ?scribbly? line with the wistful dignity of plain-line style is appropriate and successful. --DOA"@en .
