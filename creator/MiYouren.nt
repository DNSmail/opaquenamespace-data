Song dynasty (2) Mi Youren [Mi Yu-jen; original ming Yinren; zi Yuanhui; hao Haiyue Houren, Lanzhou Daoren] (b probably in Xiangyang, Hubei Province, 1086; d 1165). Son of (1) Mi Fu. He served as Minister of War and Fuwen ge Scholar under the Southern Song emperor Gaozong, authenticating and appraising painting and calligraphy. The calligrapher Huang Tingjian gave him an ancient seal marked ?Yuanhui? offering him this name as his zi (style name), in an allusion to Mi Fu?s zi, Yuanzhang. This was a reference to the father?son name sequence of 4th-century masters Wang Xizhi and Wang Xianzhi and implied an artistic continuation between the generations. Indeed, in calligraphy Mi Youren did follow Mi Fu?s style, though he did not equal him. In painting, Youren did not continue Fu?s depiction of figures and objects, but he did develop Fu?s famous misty landscape style, attaining such renown that he was overwhelmed by seekers of his paintings, and assistants had to make imitations, which he signed. Youren reinforced literati painting (wenren hua) ideals (see China, ï¿½V, 4(ii)) promulgated by Mi Fu, Su Shi, Wen Tong and others, spawning a genre of private art created by cognoscenti for each other, in which paintings functioned as personal, non-negotiable ?images of the heart? (xinyin). Youren called this type of painting ?ink play? (ximo). Eschewing linear contours and modelling strokes, he developed an unassertive, amorphous and cursory style of graded wash in wet or dry ink. Extant paintings attributed to Mi Youren include his White Clouds on the Xiao and Xiang (Xiao Xiang baiyun tu; date uncertain; Shanghai Mus.), Clearing Clouds over Distant Peaks (Yuanxiu qingyun tu; 1134; Osaka Mun. Mus.) and Impressions of Cloudy Mountains (Yunshan deyi tu; c. 1135; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.), but these may all be of later date. One reliable Southern Song emanation is the Dream Journey along Xiao and Xiang (Xiao Xiang wayoutu; Tokyo, N. Mus.), later attached to Li Longmian. It shows the liberal application of dilute inkwash, the minimalist approach to incidents and the perspective of Southern Song vistas. In the Ming period (1368?1644) the Mi style became linearized, with strands of ?Mi dots? (Mi dian) arrayed in cascading ranks to cover areas once bathed in graded wash. --DOA"@en .
