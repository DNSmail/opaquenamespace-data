Ming dynasty The background of the Zhe school can be seen in earlier Ming painting represented by the works of the bird-and-flower master Bian Wenjin ( fl early 15th century) from Fujian; Xie Huan (c. 1368? 1435), a figure painter and portraitist from Zhejiang who was a major force among Yongle (reg 1403?24) and Xuande (reg 1426?35) court painters. Xie Huan belonged to the conservative mainstream of academy painters who were especially sensitive to the moral implications of their subject-matter. Traditional legends and historical events were evaluated as much for their ideological merit and contemporary relevance as for their narrative interest or technical excellence and style. The ideal of the scholarly portrait, singly or in groups, dominated the imagery of the early part of the Ming dynasty (1368?1644). In the works of artists such as Xie Huan (fl c. 1368?1435) the type is midway between formal and informal portraiture, with a basically veristic approach softened by relaxed demeanour and surroundings. --DOA"@en .
