Song dynasty (b Zitong, Sichuan Province, 1018; d Wanqiu, Chenzhou [modern Huaiyang], Henan Province, 1079). Chinese scholar and painter. He is associated with the establishment of ink-bamboo painting as a major genre of literati painting. From an educated Confucian family in Sichuan Province in the south-west, Wen was a diligent student of the classics and on attaining the title of jinshi in the national-level civil-service examination of 1049 ranked fifth out of 500. Despite his erudition and talent, however, he never served in high government positions, spending much of his career as a civil functionary in Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces, away from the fast-paced manoeuvrings of party politics in the capital, Bianliang (modern Kaifeng, Henan Province). Wen?s gentle and unassuming character was most comfortable in the solitude of nature, where he found the embodiment of his personal ideals in nature?s ?gentleman? ( junzi), bamboo (see China, ï¿½V, 3(vi)). As a painter of bamboo, which he claims to have painted as a means of self-cultivation in his pursuit of the Dao (?way?), Wen earned lasting fame. Wen?s close friend and cousin, Su shi, the eminent statesman, poet and art theorist of the late 11th century, was instrumental in bringing attention to Wen. The narrative accounts of Wen?s paintings of bamboo by Su Shi and his brother Su Che (1039?1112) are among the most compelling descriptions of the creative act in Chinese literature. Following clearly prescribed models from an early philosophical work, the Zhuangzi, they liken Wen to Cook Ding and Wheelwright Bian, craftsmen who attained the Dao through absolute mastery of their mï¿½tier. However, the personal identification of Wen with his subject?bamboo?is a new twist and a key element in the developing literati theory of the arts, which sought to establish painting?s potential for revealing the personality of the artist (see China, ï¿½V, 4(ii)). Two large and related hanging scrolls in ink on silk (Taipei, N. Pal. Mus. and Guangzhou, A.G.) best exemplify Wen Tong?s ink-bamboo. Both represent a large and weathered branch of bamboo dipping and rising in an inverted S-curve and recall Su Shi?s descriptions of Wen?s bent bamboo, the strange shapes of which are caused by the constrictions of the gulley where it grows, a fitting image of the ideal Confucian gentleman who bends without yielding. Nearer and further leaves are distinguished by gradations in ink tone, in keeping with a detailed account of Wen?s technique by the contemporary critic Mi Fu, and the marvellous sense of organic development accords well with Su Shi?s descriptions of Wen engaged in the creative act. Wen is credited with being the founder of the ink-bamboo tradition. His followers were numerous; they are collectively designated the Huzhou school of bamboo painting, after Wen?s final assignment as governor of Huzhou in Zhejiang Province. --DOA"@en .
