Qing dynasty Nanjing School: Term used to refer to a group of Chinese painters active in Nanjing chiefly in the second half of the 17th century, at the start of the Qing period (1644?1912). The Nanjing school was roughly contemporaneous with the Anhui school, which was active in the adjacent Anhui Province. By the late 17th century the leading painters of the school were already identified as the Eight Masters of Jinling [Nanjing] ( Jinling bajia). The earliest extant listing of the eight is by Zhang Geng (1685?1760) in his 1739 Guochao hua zheng lu (?Catalogue of painting in our dynasty?); most were born elsewhere, but all were active in Nanjing as professional artists. Later lists vary, but the painters most often included are Gong xian, the leader of the school; Fan Qi (1615/16?c. 1694) from Nanjing; Gao Cen (fl 1670s; d 1689) from Hangzhou in Zhejiang Province; Zou Zhe (fl c. 1641?84) from Suzhou, Jiangsu Province; Ye Xin (fl 1650s?70s) from Huating, modern Songjiang; Wu Hong (fl 1670s?1680s) from Junqi, Jiangsu Province; Xie Sun (fl 1679) from Jiangning, Guangxi Province; and Hu Cao (fl 1681) from Jiangning. Others sometimes associated with the school include Lï¿½ Qian (fl 1660s?80s) from Suiming, Sichuan Province; Wu Dan and Liu Yu (both fl 1670s? 80s), Nanjing natives; and Gong Xian?s pupil Wang Gai (fl 1670s?90s) from Xiushui, Zhejiang Province. -DOA"@en .
