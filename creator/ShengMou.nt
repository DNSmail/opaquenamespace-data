Yuan dynasty (b Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province; fl 1310?60). Chinese painter. He came from a family of professional painters, studying first with his father, Sheng Hong, an artist who had been active in Lin?an (now Hangzhou), the capital of the Southern Song dynasty (1127?1279). He also studied with Chen Lin, himself a student of the influential early Yuan-period (1279?1368) painter Zhao Mengfu. Also active in Jiaxing was the literati painter Wu Zhen, one of the Four Masters of the Yuan period, who may also have had some influence on Sheng?s work. According to records, Sheng was skilful at painting landscapes, figures and bird-and-flower subjects. Most of the 60 or so extant works attributed to Sheng are landscapes, usually featuring figures. Because of the variety of his subject-matter, Sheng Mao is difficult to identify firmly either as a professional artist or as one of the literati. The themes of most of his paintings?famous figures from the past, scholars? retreats, scholars at leisure playing musical instruments or contemplating streams and mountains, and virtuous fishermen?are common to contemporary literati works and probably reflect the concerns of both the artist and his patrons. However, unlike literati artists of the period, Sheng rarely added poetry to his works. Most of his inscriptions consisted only of his signature, the date and sometimes a title or dedication. Nevertheless, several of his works bear poetic colophons by prominent literati contemporaries, suggesting that Sheng had friends and associates among this group. Recluse Fishing by Autumn Trees (1350; New York, Met.), Waiting for a Ferry on an Autumnal River (1351; Beijing, Pal. Mus.) and Boating on a River in Autumn (1361; ink and colours on paper; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.) bear several inscriptions and words of praise by literati painters such as Wei Jiuding and Wang Fu. Sheng Mao?s paintings display complex stylistic influences and betray his professional training. Pleasant Summer in a Mountain Retreat (hanging scroll, ink and colours on silk, 1213ï¿½578 mm; Kansas City, MO, Nelson?Atkins Mus. A.) is a landscape rendered in the archaistic blue-and-green style (qinglï¿½), which originated in the Tang period (ad 618?907) and was exemplified in the works of Li Sixun (see Li (1)). This manner was later associated with professional artists, as were the meticulous brushwork and detailed figures, architecture and landscape elements that are characteristic of Sheng?s work. The critic Xia Wenyan, in his Tuhui baojian (?Precious mirror for examining painting?, preface 1365), praised Sheng?s brushwork for its refinement, but observed that Sheng was ?often carried away by technical skill?, an allusion to the fact that technical virtuosity was anathema to literati artists, who valued amateur status, spontaneity and personal expression. Other works place Sheng stylistically within the literati lineage of Zhao Mengfu by way of Chen Lin. Sheng?s brushwork in Boating on a River in Autumn has a vitality and spontaneity to rival that of any contemporary literatus. A colophon on this work by Wei Jiuding particularly praises Sheng?s trees for the beauty of their ?awkwardness?, a much sought-after quality in literati painting. Some of his works depicting scholars as hermits or fishermen, such as Hermit Seated under Autumn Trees (hanging scroll, Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.) and Fisherman on a Boat under Trees (album leaf, Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.), are comparable to the literati paintings of his own time. Nevertheless, they equally show some influence from the 10th-century masters of landscape, Dong Yuan and Juran, such as the use of ?unravelled rope? modelling strokes: following ancient models was another major concern of Yuan-period literati painters. Since most of Sheng Mao?s extant works are of consistently high quality, it is reasonable to suppose that the artist was a major figure among the many accomplished painters active in the Jiangnan, the area south of the River Yangzi, during the last 50 years of the Yuan period. --DOA"@en .
