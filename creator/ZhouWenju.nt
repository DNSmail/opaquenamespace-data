Five dynasties (b Jurong, near modern Nanjing, Jiangsu Province; fl ad 942?61). Chinese painter. He served as a daizhao (painter in attendance) at the Painting Academy of the Southern Tang court (ad 937?75). He may first have become prominent during the reign of the emperor Li Bian (937?43), when it is recorded that he was ordered to paint the Nanzhuang (Southern Village), though Guo Ruoxu dates this event to between 961 and 975. He participated in executing a joint work at the banquet held by the ruler, Li Jing (reg 943?61), on New Year?s day, 947. He was probably dead before the Song (960?1279) conquered the Southern Tang, since he is not recorded among the painters of the Southern Tang entering the Song Painting Academy. Zhou was known for his brushwork of the zhanbi (?tremulous brush?) type, probably a method to render the fluttering quality of silken garments. According to the Xuanhe huapu (?Xuanhe collection of painting?; preface dated 1120) he learnt the zhanbi technique from Li Yu (reg 961? 75), famous for his calligraphy in this manner. This is unlikely, however, since Zhou was a well-established painter 20 years before Li Yu ascended the throne. Early sources record that Zhou was a versatile painter, accomplished in depicting figures, carriages and horses, architecture, trees, mountains and rivers, and excelling in female beauties. In paintings of the latter he reportedly worked in the manner of the Tang (ad 618?907) painter Zhou fang ?but still more delicately?. According to Mi Fu, Zhou Wenju?s paintings of female beauties are distinguished from Zhou Fang?s by the use of zhanbi in the outline of garments; according to Guo Ruoxu, however, they do not feature zhanbi. The majority of paintings attributed to Zhou Wenju are in this genre, the most important being Ladies of the Court (Gongzhong tu; sections at Cambridge, MA, Fogg; Cleveland, OH, Mus. A.; Florence, I Tatti; and New York, Met.). A colophon of 1140 by Zhang Zheng, mounted with the Cleveland scroll, states that it is a copy of a painting by Zhou Wenju. The work is in the tradition of Zhou Fang, but the faded colouring contrasts with the clear hues of early genre paintings and may mirror the taste of the copyist. The four known sections of the composition were executed by at least two different hands. While the scrolls in Cleveland and Florence show no trace of zhanbi, the other two feature a slight tremble in the lines of the garments. The figures are tightly organized and naturally rendered; situations in court life are depicted in a lively manner. The minimal setting is an archaic feature. Zhou was also an accomplished portrait painter. The Double Screen (Chongping tu) is a well- documented composition (good copies in Washington, DC, Freer, and Beijing, Pal. Mus.) showing two men playing weiqi (chess), with two others watching. The figures have been identified as the ruler Li Jing and his three brothers. Behind them, a painted screen depicts an interior scene containing yet another painted screen; this format gives the scroll its name. Painted screens in interior scenes, typical in paintings of this period, reflect an interest in the nature of art. The Double Screen composition features an extensive use of zhanbi; in the Beijing version it is particularly mannered and possibly exaggerated compared to the original. The composition exemplifies the fine quality of Southern Tang genre paintings. The refined life at court is depicted with a sense for telling detail, and the figures are grouped in tight interplay. Three other portraits by Zhou, of the ruler Li Yu, are recorded in the Xuanhe huapu. It seems that in his early years, however, Zhou?s portraiture was less highly esteemed than his figure painting. In the New Year?s day joint work of 947 the privilege of painting the ruler, Li Jung, was conceded to Gao Taichong, whereas Zhou was responsible for the imperial princes, officials and musicians (probably a female orchestra). Zhou Wenju, Wang Qihan ( fl 961?75) and Gu Hongzhong ( fl c. 943?60), all prominent figure painters at the Jiangnan (southern) Court, gradually made figure painting a more psychologically subtle art form. They placed figures in more natural groups, as in Ladies Bathing Children, and used interior details to add realism. The influence of these artists is clearly visible in depictions of court life by Song-period masters. --DOA"@en .
