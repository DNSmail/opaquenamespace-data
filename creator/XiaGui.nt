Southern Song dynasty (b Lin?an [modern Hangzhou], Zhejiang Province; fl c. 1195?c. 1235). Chinese painter. Xia Gui and his close contemporary Ma yuan are considered the two greatest painters of the Southern Song (1127?1279) Academy (see China, ï¿½V, 4(i)(c)). They established the Ma?Xia style, a term that came to describe not merely their own work but an entire aesthetic. Early writers provide little biographical information about Xia Gui. Zhou Mi, in his account of the Southern Song capital Lin?an (c. 1280), included both Xia and Ma Yuan in a list of ten painters under the heading Yuqian huayuan (?Art academy in the imperial presence?). Zhuang Su wrote (1298) that Xia was a zhihou (usher) in the Academy under Emperor Lizong (reg 1225?64) and that he painted landscapes and figures. This is partly corroborated by the deciphering of a seal belonging to Lizong?s empress, Xie, on a handscroll of Twelve Views of Landscape, of which four views survive (ink on silk; Kansas City, MO, Nelson?Atkins Mus. A.). Zhuang Su further associated Xia?s painting with the degenerate taste of a declining dynasty and described him as ?exceedingly common and distasteful?, and ?only able to realize a name for himself in his own time?. Tang Hou included Xia in a brief list of famous Academy artists (c. 1320) but dismissed the importance of all except Li Tang. The early rejection of Xia Gui can be explained by the rise of anti-Academic literati taste in the early part of the Yuan period (1279?1368). Towards the end of the Yuan, however, evaluation of Xia Gui became more positive both among those of Academic taste and among the literati. In 1365 Xia Wenyan wrote that Xia Gui was a daizhao (painter in attendance) under Emperor Ningzong (reg 1195?1224) when he received the honour of the jindai (?golden belt?), and that he painted human figures, distilling ?high and low?. Xia Wenyan also described Xia Gui?s technique: ink tones like the laying on of powdery colours, brushwork that was venerable and time-honoured, and ink that flowed dripping and wet, ?unique?. In painting landscapes, no Academician since Li Tang was his equal. His snow scenes were entirely after Fan Kuan. In 1344 Ni Zan, writing about a Xia Gui mountain landscape no longer extant, clearly defined the artist?s place in painting history: he suggested that a tradition with roots in Jing hao and Fan Kuan and developed by Li Tang, who moved to Lin?an at the end of his life, culminated in Xia Gui and Ma Yuan. Even the late Ming scholar?painter Dong Qichang, who usually disapproved of Academy artists, commended Xia. In 1627 he wrote, with respect to the Twelve Views handscroll, that Xia Gui followed Li Tang but with greater cursoriness. He particularly praised Xia?s handling of ink, ?now dissolving, now disappearing?, such that the ink play (moxi) of Mi Fu and Mi Youren was at his brushtip. This was high praise indeed, for the Two Mis were considered the epitome of scholar?painter ideals. The growing acceptance of Xia Gui within a defined tradition was partly due to his strong and forceful style, especially in painting winter landscapes. In recognition of this style, the painter, calligrapher and statesman Wang Duo (1592?1652) attributed to Xia Gui an anonymous Song hanging scroll, Landscape (Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.), citing the Fan Kuan?Li Tang relationship and comparing the painting?s stark and sombre snow and rocks to ?cold iron? (hantie). Scholars are uncertain about the authenticity of paintings attributed to Xia Gui. Two important album leaves in the shape of rounded fans, Gazing at the Waterfall (ink and colour on silk; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.) and Full Sail on the Misty River (ink on silk; Cleveland, OH, Mus. A.), appear to indicate an early Xia Gui style closely connected with 12th-century painting, especially the followers of Li Tang. Both have signatures, but that on the latter is open to interpretation and has been attributed by some to Xia Gui?s son, Xia Shen, despite being in a believable 12th-century style. Five paintings define the subtleties of Xia?s mature style: A Pure and Remote View of Streams and Mountains (see fig.); the four surviving views in Twelve Views of Landscape; an album leaf in the shape of a rounded fan, Sailboat in the Rain (ink and slight colour on silk; Boston, MA, Mus. F.A.); a small hanging scroll, Landscape (ink on silk; Tokyo, N. Mus.); and a leaf from the album Hikk?en (?The brush-tilled garden?), Rainy Landscape (Tokyo, Nakamura priv. col.). Characteristic features of these are close promontories with active, leaning trees; leaves created by moist, melting ink-touches, perhaps with a ?split brush?; crisp, swordlike, bare branch-ends; sharp cliffs accented by ?axe-cut strokes? ( fupi cun), a convention inherited from Li Tang; gentle washes for land surfaces or distant mountain ranges; probing landspits fingering open areas of water and sky; and mists fading into the distance leaving only the spare suggestion of far hill-crests or light wash melting into silent spaces. Some landscapes were wet and bending with the movement of wind and rain, others embraced by quiet mists, and yet others crystal clear with sculpted, firm mountain peaks. Small figures, including travellers, fishermen, scholars and priests, inhabit Xia Gui?s landscapes, perhaps indicative of the appearance of his alleged figure paintings, none of which survive. Other abbreviated forms include a bridge, boat, gateway, rustic hamlet or temple; Xia was noted for the free-hand rendering of architectural elements (without a ruler). Xia Gui?s son, Xia Shen, continued his father?s general style, partially exemplified by Wang Cuxiang?s (1501?68) copy (1541) of a 14-leaf Xia Shen album (Tapei, N. Pal. Mus.). Xia Gui?s influence, particularly in association with that of Ma Yuan, pervaded painting throughout East Asia. The Ma?Xia style was stressed by the painters Sun Junze ( fl early 14th century) and Wang Li (b 1322) and in the 15th and 16th centuries became the foundation of the so-called Zhe school, headed by Dai Jin. In Japan, Xia Gui?s style had a major influence on ink painting of the Muromachi period (1333?1568) (see Japan, ï¿½VI, 4(ii)). --DOA"@en .
