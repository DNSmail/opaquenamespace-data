Qing dynasty (b Shanghang, Fujian Province, 1682; d Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, 1762). Chinese painter. One of the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou (see Yangzhou school), Hua Yan painted figures, landscapes, birds, flowers and insects. A strong sense of humour is revealed in his depictions of animals: he painted subjects such as kittens in a heap, frogs fighting, a turtle on its back and sway-backed, pop-eyed horses. His independent spirit in this genre was widely acclaimed by critics. Qin Zuyong (1825?84) even praised his paintings as comparable to those of Yun Shouping, the great bird-and-flower painter. Autumn Scene (see fig.) is an example of his landscape painting. In the middle of the composition a scholar with a staff in his hand and his back to the viewer stands on a promontory that rises from the right corner, leading the eye towards him in a diagonal movement. Framed in a square by a tall rock to his left and a pair of spindly trees to his right, he gazes across an expanse of water at distant mountains, capped by a single peak. The brushwork is quick and sketchy, and the colours are pale: green underfoot, pink leaves, powder-blue mountains. Water is suggested only by the lines of currents in the foreground. There are only a few leaves on the trees and these are depicted almost as caricatures: as circles on one tree, brief horizontal lines on the other. The very dry, rough brushwork on the rocks and trees contrasts with the fine lines of the scholar and the grasses. A partially revealed cliff on the left is offset by two columns of calligraphy below it. Hua Yan?s models in calligraphy are cited as Zhong You (ad 151?230) and Yu Shinan (558?638), but it is clear that this is not the hand of a literary man, practised in the study of early models. The characters are broad, loosely spaced and rounded, and have a naivety and awkwardness that suit the style of his painting, itself terse and somewhat gauche. Conversation in Autumn (hanging scroll, 1732; Cleveland, OH, Mus. A.) is a far more energetic and complex painting. In the lower half of the work there are sharp, rain-drenched, near-naked trees on a foundation of pointed rocks. These craggy boulders are scribbled with energetic, lengthwise hatchmarks that lead the eye to the open window of a house, where two gentlemen can be seen within. The interior scene, framed with simple, straight, geometric lines, gives a sense of opening and expansion. The speckle of black, wet bamboo leaves and sodden, misty branches over the roof draw the eye upwards towards the narrow columns of calligraphy at the upper right, executed in a wild and agitated cursive script that echoes the effect of the trees in the foreground. --DOA"@en .
