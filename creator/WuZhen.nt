Yuan dynasty (b Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province, 1280; d 1354). Chinese painter. Although he was well educated, especially in philosophy and swordsmanship, he never took the examinations to enter government, preferring to spend most of his life in his home town with occasional visits to such nearby towns as Hangzhou and Wuxing. A scholar of the Yijing (?Book of changes?), he practised fortune-telling to make a living. As a painter he was not as successful commercially as Sheng Mao (one of his neighbours), but he had his own circle of literati friends, including such painters as Wu Guan and Zhang Guan and such scholars as Tao Zhongyi. As a painter, Wu is known for his landscapes and paintings of bamboo, most of which are in ink on paper, in free brushwork; his calligraphy is also noted for its cursive style (caoshu). His earliest known painting is Two Junipers (hanging scroll, ink on silk, 1328; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.), which is strongly influenced by the 10th-century master Juran. Wu?s interest in the free use of texture strokes on mountains and rocks and in the shapes of trees and branches is already apparent. Central Mountain (handscroll, ink on paper, 1336; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.) shows the large, broad brushstrokes and simplified composition typical of his mature works. In his landscapes his favourite subject is the hermit fisherman, a theme drawn from an ancient Chinese allegory, in which wise men, finding the world in turmoil, maintain their personal integrity by withdrawing from society to live like fishermen on rivers and lakes. The most famous paintings of this subject are Fishermen, of which two sections from an original four are extant (1336; both Beijing, Pal. Mus.), Hermit Fisherman in Lake Dongting (1341), Fisherman (1342; see fig.), A Lonely Fisherman on an Autumn River (all hanging scrolls, Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.) and Fishermen, after Jing Hao (handscroll, 1345, Shanghai Mus.; similar composition, 1342, Washington, DC, Freer). All of these display Wu?s bold and free brushwork, his extremely simplified composition and his highly personal mode of expression. Other works demonstrate Wu?s facility to work in different styles. Spring Morning on the Clear River (Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.) is a grand landscape in the tradition of the Northern Song period (960?1127), with high mountains and deep vistas that show a strong influence of the 10th-century masters Dong Yuan and Juran. Another interesting but quite different landscape is Eight Views of Jiahe (1344; Taipei, Lo Chia-lun priv. col.), a topographical painting with many inscriptions indicating specific sites and locations in his home town. It is one of the rare works based on actual scenes that anticipated the development of the topographical style of landscape that flourished during the Ming period (1368?1644). However, even in this realistic portrayal of Jiaxing, his brushwork remains blunt and free. By contrast, Poetic Feeling in a Thatched Pavilion (1347; Cleveland, OH, Mus. A.), a landscape painted for a friend, shows a complete disregard for realistic detail, with free brushwork creating rhythmic patterns. One of the most famous Yuan period painters of bamboo, Wu wrote long inscriptions on all his bamboo paintings, indicating his artistic lineage and expressing the symbolic significance of bamboo. These include Bamboo and Rock (hanging scroll, 1347), Bamboo Studies (album of 20 leaves, 1350; both Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.) and Bamboo after Su Shi (hanging scroll, 1350; Washington, DC, Freer). As indicated in his inscriptions, he followed the literati tradition of painting bamboo in monochrome black ink, first established as a literati motif by artists such as Wen Tong and Su Shi in the Northern Song period (960?1127) and Li Kan in the Yuan (1279?1368), all of whom used it to express the moral integrity and aesthetic superiority of an educated gentleman. In his album Bamboo Studies, painted for his son, Wu not only displayed the different manners of depicting the bamboo as used by Song and Yuan period masters but also included many other compositions of his own, portraying the bamboo growing upward, hanging downward, in a clear day, or blowing in the wind. All these bamboo paintings display a very consistent style: simple composition, bold brushwork and abstraction from nature. Wu Zhen was not recognized as a painter until the 15th century, when a number of painters active in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, notably Shen Zhou, the founder of the Wu school of literati painting (see China, ï¿½V, 4(ii)), became highly interested in his style. By the late 16th century Wu was considered one of the Four Great Masters of the Yuan. --DOA"@en .
