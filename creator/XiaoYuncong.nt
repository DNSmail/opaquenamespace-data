Qing dynasty (b Wuhu, Anhui Province, 1596; d 1673). Chinese painter and poet. He was born some 150 km north of the region inhabited by artists of the Anhui school, with which he became associated, and was a contemporary of its leading member, Hongren. His family hoped he would pursue an official career, but Xiao failed the civil service examinations and instead became a semi-professional painter. He joined the loyalist Fu she (Restoration Society) in 1638 and in 1645 was forced to flee Wuhu in the face of invading Qing troops. On his return two years later he found his house ruined. Perhaps partly from a need to make money, Xiao participated in two important printing projects, the Lisao tu (?Illustrations to the poem Lisao?; c. 1645) and the Taiping shanshui tu (?Topographical illustrations of the Taiping region?; 1648). Both projects brought together some of the best artists of 17th-century China and are exceptional examples of woodblock-carving and printing, an art that flourished in Anhui Province during the Ming period (1368?1644; for further discussion of printing of this period see China, ï¿½XIII, 21(ii)). Xiao contributed 64 illustrations for the Lisao tu, including the image for the title poem itself (Lisao or Encountering Sorrow; attributed to the 4th-century bc poet Qu Yuan). The motive for publication of these poems, which had been given political interpretations since the Han period (206 bc?ad 220), may have been to express bitterness over the fall of the Ming dynasty, a feeling expressed by Xiao in his own poetry. The figures and animals that Xiao painted in the Lisao tu, with their awkward and sometimes grotesque distortions, were perhaps similarly inspired, a reflection of Xiao?s dissatisfaction with his own aborted official career as well as with political developments. Like his contemporary Chen Hongshou, he transformed the mannerisms of figure drawing by artisans and craftsmen of his period into original and engaging images. The combination of poetry, imitations of old painting styles and local topographical interest seen in the Taiping shanshui tu, for which Xiao provided 43 scenes of Taiping Prefecture, was a novel format. Xiao Yuncong?s best work appeared in albums and handscrolls: he seems to have been uncomfortable with the large hanging-scroll format. His early style, dependent on Song period (960?1279) models, was often fussy and crowded with detail. Although he attempted hanging scrolls in the dry, linear manner typical of Anhui school artists, such works lack the overall compositional unity of the best Anhui paintings. Albums painted by Xiao in the 1650s (e.g. album, 1653; Hefei, Anhui Prov. Mus.) contain leaves after 10th-century landscapists such as Li Cheng, Jing Hao and others. Xiao improved considerably as a painter in the late 1660s and early 1670s. Xiao?s mature paintings often included overlapping, simplified forms, red-robed figures and a combination of pale blue and red-brown washes with strokes of shaded wash. A long handscroll, Landscape with Mountains and Rivers (1669; Los Angeles, CA, Co. Mus. A.), demonstrates the painter?s technical prowess in using a dry-brush manner to construct compositions of great formal complexity. --DOA"@en .
