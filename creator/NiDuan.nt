Ming dynasty Zhe School: The background of the Zhe school can be seen in earlier Ming painting represented by the works of the bird-and-flower master Bian Wenjin ( fl early 15th century) from Fujian; Xie Huan (c. 1368? 1435), a figure painter and portraitist from Zhejiang who was a major force among Yongle (reg 1403?24) and Xuande (reg 1426?35) court painters; Shang Xi ( fl 1430?40) from Jiangsu and Shi Rui ( fl 1426?35) from Hangzhou; Ni Duan, a painter of landscapes with figures, also from Hangzhou; and Li Zai, a landscapist from Fujian. The Zhe school departed from these artists? continuation of conservative Song Academy styles and its origin can conveniently be located in Dai Jin?s works, especially in those of his middle period, dating from the second quarter of the 15th century. The later style of the court academy can be characterized as a mixture of the Zhe school and the traditional academic style; the 15th-century court figure painting of Shang Xi and Ni Duan was also indebted to the Southern Song style of Liu Songnian, Li Gao (1166?1234) and Su Hanchen. -- DOA"@en .
