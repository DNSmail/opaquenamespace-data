Painter. He was the eldest son of (1) Sumiyoshi Jokei. In 1674 he became a monk at My?h?in on Mount Hiei (Kyoto Prefect.) and was granted the name Gukei. In 1675 he produced paintings for the T?fukumonin Palace in Kyoto. In 1684 he moved from Kyoto to Edo (now Tokyo), and the following year he was appointed official painter (goy? eshi) to the shogunate, superseding the Kanga (Chinese-style) painters of the Kan? school who had previously held the office. This change can be seen as a conscious decision to appoint a representative of a native painting school of the Yamatoe tradition. This followed the earlier appointment of the former head of the Sumiyoshi school, Jokei, and of Tosa Mitsuoki (see Tosa, (3)) to the Edokoro (Office of Painting) of the court (1654). These honours confirmed the leading position of the Sumiyoshi and Tosa schools within the painting establishment of the day (see Japan, ?VI, 4(ii)). Like his father, Gukei continued the miniaturist tradition of painting in a small format that had begun with the Tosa school. His representative works include: Hakozaki Hachimang? engi emaki (?Handscroll of the history of the Hakozaki Hachiman shrine?; 1672); Genz? Daishi engi emaki (?Handscroll of the life of Saint Genz??; 1679; Kyoto, Kaneiji); Genji monogatari emaki (?Handscroll of the Tale of Genji?; priv. col.); Uji sh?i monogatari emaki (?Handscroll of the tales of Uji?; Tokyo, Idemitsu Mus. A.); Tsurezuregusa gaj? (?Picture album of the Tsurezuregusa?; 1678; Tokyo, N. Mus.). His Tohi zukan (?Town and country handscroll?; Kyoto, K?fukuji; Tokyo, N. Mus.; Dublin, Chester Beatty Lib.; see fig.) deserves particular attention as a work that adopted this intimate painting form to depict t?sei f?zoku (?contemporary customs and manners?). Each picture possesses a similar theme: the interweaving of annual celebrations with the changing seasons, and the tranquillity of human activity, depicted in a vivid manner. The combination of a lyrical, intimate style and a light palette illustrates the individualistic world of Gukei, one of Japan?s most accomplished miniaturists. -Grove Art Online"@en .
