Chinese painter, calligrapher and poet. Born into a wealthy family of the scholar?official class, he is known for his landscapes (see fig.) and flower paintings. He was once a student of Wen Zhengming and was loosely associated with the Wu school. He is best known for his landscapes in the style of the Northern Song-period (960?1127) master Mi Fu and his son, Mi Youren, and of their Yuan-period (1279?1368) interpreter, Gao Kegong (see fig.). The Mi style was rarely appreciated by Suzhou artists, but Chen?s affinity for it could be explained by the fact that his family owned a painting by Mi Youren. The style is characterized by cone-shaped or rounded hills composed of large, horizontal, wet blobs of ink applied in vertical layers. Chen added motifs and techniques borrowed from the Suzhou artist Shen Zhou, such as rhomboid plateaux outlined with dry brush lines and squat, blocky figures. Chen further modified the Mi style, giving it a rich, colouristic effect by introducing fluid colour washes and large blobs of blue and buff, as in his Hills and Streams after Rain (handscroll, ink and colour on paper; Kansas City, MO, Nelson?Atkins Mus. A.). Chen Shun?s flower paintings range from isolated, single sprays of blossoms to tangled masses of grasses and flowering plants. He worked in both ink monochrome and colour, using an unevenly loaded brush to create shaded strokes suggesting depth and shadow. Chen enhanced the quality of depth and form with a puddling technique, applying dark tones over still-wet light areas. In some of his flower paintings, for example Garden Flowers (album, ink and colours on gold-flecked paper, 1540; New York, Met.), he combined ink-outlined, colour-filled (goule) blooms with those done in the ?boneless? (mogu) style. He covered the surface of one page in this album with flowers of different shapes, colours and sizes: large white lilies, smaller pink carnations and tiny yellow asters. In common with his landscapes, his flower paintings are sensuous and richly coloured. His influence is apparent in the work of Xu Wei and Jiang Pu, whose lotuses directly imitate those by Chen Shun. He and Xu Wei are often referred to together by later artists and critics as baiyang qingteng (?full sun, green tendrils?) for their expressive style of flower painting.--DOA"@en .
