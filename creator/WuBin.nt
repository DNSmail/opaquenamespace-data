Ming dynasty (b Putian, Fujian Province; fl c. 1568?1626). Chinese painter. One of the most talented of a small group of mid-17th-century professional artists active in Nanjing and Beijing, whose paintings of landscapes and figural compositions presented an alternative mode to the prevailing style of the amateur scholar-painters. Under the Wanli emperor (reg 1573?1620), Wu was called to service at the southern Ming (1368?1644) capital of Nanjing. He served mainly as a court painter but was also employed by private patrons and Buddhist temples. In the 1620s he was overheard criticizing the notorious eunuch Wei Zhongxian (1568?1628) and subsequently imprisoned. Thereafter, records of Wu cease. The conservative landscapes and narrative paintings that Wu executed for the court are best represented by the handscroll Greeting the Spring (1600; Cleveland, OH, Mus. A.) and the album Record of the Year?s Holidays (Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.). These fine-line, colourful early paintings, characterized by incidental detail and decorative effect, represent meticulous professional variants on the late Wu school style, the amateur landscape painting tradition based in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, in the mid-Ming period. By the first decade of the 17th century, however, Wu was pursuing a new landscape mode based on Northern Song (960?1127) models (see China, ï¿½V, 3(vi)(a)). Professional painters from Wu?s native Fujian had begun a Song revival in the early Ming period; in addition, Wu had the opportunity while in Nanjing to study old master paintings in both the imperial and private collections and to meet other painters, notably Mi Wanzhong (1570?1628), likewise engaged in reviving Northern Song styles. Wu must also have been exposed to European paintings and prints presented by Jesuit missionaries to the court (see China, ï¿½XIII, 21(ii)). The representational and illusionistic concerns of Western art may have stimulated an interest in the native Northern Song style, which similarly aimed at naturalistic effects. Wu?s new landscape style is best represented by paintings such as Streams and Mountains Far from the World (1615; Takatsuki, Hashimoto priv. col.), Landscape with Palaces (Berkeley, U. CA, A. Mus.) and a View of Tiantai Mountain (1607; Honolulu, HI, Acad. A.; see fig.). Northern Song influence is readily apparent in Wu?s monumental scale, monolithic vision and naturalistic rendering of surface effects. However, whereas Northern Song artists painted stable and rational landscapes representing microcosmic versions of an ideal cosmic order, Wu produced mannerist renditions of the earlier style, attenuating and distorting classical forms to create a visionary world of fantastic structures, whose undulating, unbalanced shapes often have no logical connection, and where the distinction between solid and void is no longer clear. The Song idiom is also the model for Wu?s painstakingly naturalistic surface detail on cliffs, with peaks swathed in convincing mists and believable shadows cast over their sides. Wu thus sets up a constant tension between the real and the unreal and seems to suggest that the coherence of the Song world order, though he longs for it, no longer has meaning for the Ming. Wu also played a central role in the late Ming revival of figure painting. A lay Buddhist, he received commissions from temples to paint images of Buddhist luohan (Skt arhats; ?enlightened ones?). His best-known figure paintings include the handscroll Five Hundred Luohan (Cleveland, OH, Mus. A.) and the album Deities of the Surangama Sutra (Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.). As in his adaptation of the Song landscape mode, Wu alludes to but then distorts an earlier painting style. His luohan are clearly modelled after those of the Five Dynasties (ad 907?60) monk?painter Guanxiu, but they are caricatures and figures of irony. Wu thus intimates that luohan, embodiments of spiritual transcendence, have no more place in the sullied world of the Ming than the harmonious landscapes of the Song. --DOA"@en .
