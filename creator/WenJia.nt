Ming dynasty (b Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, 1501; d Suzhou, 1583). Painter and calligrapher, son of Wen Zhengming. He received a formal classical education and benefited from contact with the learned associates of his father. He succeeded in passing the local xiucai (first degree) examinations and was appointed gongsheng (tribute student). He did not pass the provincial juren (second degree) examinations and had an undistinguished government career. A highly cultured gentleman, Wen Jia was a member of the third generation of the Wu school, and his early works show the profound influence of his father. His activity as a calligrapher was overshadowed by the greater reputation of his older brother Wen Peng (1498? 1573), who practised the full range of script types: seal (zhuanshu), clerical (lishu), regular (kaishu) and cursive (caoshu). The two brothers were lively participants in Suzhou literati life, often collaborating on projects that combined painting, poetry and calligraphy. Together they compiled the Tingyun guan tie, an anthology of calligraphy published in 1560. Highly regarded as a connoisseur, Wen Jia was frequently asked to authenticate masterpieces, especially after the death of his father. He wrote colophons on paintings by Chen Huong ( fl ad 725?56), Guo Xi, Ma Yuan, Zhao Mengfu, Shen Zhou, Wen Zhengming, Zhou Chen, Tang Yin, Qiu Ying and Chen Shun. After the painting and calligraphy belonging to the powerful official Yan Song (1480?1565) were confiscated, Wen Jia was invited to write the catalogue Qianshan tang shuhua ji, dated 1569. Wen Jia?s paintings are modest and refined, with numerous allusions to the past. His unpretentious brushwork epitomizes the literati ideal of pingdan (plainness). Most of them illustrate poetry or document scholarly activities. From 1525 to 1559 he explored a variety of different themes and styles. After the death of Wen Zhengming in 1559, Wen Jia focused on consolidating his own artistic personality. He worked in the mode of masters of the Yuan period (1279?1368): Ni zan was a particular favourite, since his paintings embodied the elegant refinement that most appealed to Wen Jia. Wen?s paintings from the 1560s include illustrations of a poem by Bai Juyi (ad 772?846), Pipa Xing (?Lute song?; hanging scroll, ink and light colour on paper, 1569; Osaka, Mun. Mus.), and another by Su Shi, Chibi fu (?Ode on the red cliff?; handscroll, ink on paper, 1563; Nanjing, Jiangsu Prov. Mus.). His integral involvement with the Suzhou literati is affirmed by Parting by the River Bank (handscroll, ink and colour on paper, c. 1563; San Francisco, CA, Asian A. Mus.). It was painted to commemorate the departure of the official Yuan Zunni (1523?74) to Beijing to take the jinshi examinations and has farewell poems by six of his friends following the painting. The last 13 years of Wen Jia?s life were prolific. He wrote a large number of colophons and continued to work in the mode of Ni Zan, as well as to illustrate poetry such as Landscape in the Spirit of Verses by Du Fu (album leaf, 1576; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.). His repertory expanded to include mythical Daoist scenic spots, for example Daoist Landscapes (handscroll, 1573; Tokyo, N. Mus.) and On the Isles of the Immortals (hanging scroll, n.d.; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.). Landscape Dedicated to Xiang Yuanbian (see fig.) celebrated the Suzhou collector?s 54th birthday. Huangfu Fang (1503?82) composed a birthday song that Wen Jia wrote on the scroll. The painting depicts a scholarly gathering with blunt brushstrokes reminiscent of Shen zhou. It incorporates a deliberate creation of spatial ambiguity through a slanted horizon to the left of the background mountain mass. This device represents a new direction in painting and anticipates the distortions employed by Dong Qichang and Wang Yuanqi. Although the Wu school tradition declined during the late 16th century, there were certain innovations that were continued by later artists, particularly those active in the area of Songjiang. Wen Jia epitomized the typical scholar?artist active within his circle as a poet, calligrapher, painter and connoisseur. --DOA"@en .
