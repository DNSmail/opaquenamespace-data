Ming dynasty (b Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, c. 1460?61; d Suzhou, 1527). Chinese calligrapher, scholar, essayist and poet. Born into an illustrious Suzhou family, he was commended in the provincial examinations, the second stage of the civil service career ladder, at the age of 33 but failed in several attempts at the national examinations. In 1514 he took office as magistrate of Xingning County in Guangdong Province and in 1522 was promoted to assistant prefectural magistrate of Yingtian District (now Nanjing). He retired after less than a year and died at the age of 67. Zhu was an outstanding representative of certain literary circles in Suzhou, revered not only for his calligraphy, but also for his scholarship, essays and poetry. His individual and non-conformist beliefs made him severely critical of Song Neo-Confucianism, the orthodox teaching of his day, seeing it as both ill-founded and constricting. His love of liberty and adherence to the classics are reflected in his calligraphy, which is at once informed by a thorough acquaintance with the classical masters and executed with an expansive and uninhibited flair. By his early twenties Zhu Yunming was renowned in Suzhou for his calligraphy, which showed the influence of the cursive script (caoshu) of his maternal grandfather, Xu Youzhen (1407?72), and the regular script (kaishu) of his father-in-law, Li Yingzhen (1431?93). Zhu made a thorough study of Jin (ad 265?420), Tang (ad 618?907), and Song (960?1279) calligraphers, taking as models masters such as Wang Xizhi (see Wang (i), (1)) and Huaisu. He also studied stelae from the Han, Wei and Su Dynasties periods (206 bc?ad 589). His own calligraphy shows abundant variation, and he excelled particularly in the art of unrestrained cursive script. The best known of his surviving masterpieces reveal his genius with two fundamental brushstrokes. The first is dragged continuously in circular fluency, carrying on a 4th-century ad tradition of continuous cursive script; see, for example, the Seven-character Eight-line Poem (Qiyan lushi, 1525; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.). The other stroke is a type of dissipated dot which takes advantage of the interlocking lines and vigour of the calligraphy to create a compact structure. The works which best exemplify this pioneering characteristic are the Cao Zhi Poem (c. 1526; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.) and the Ode on the Red Cliff (Chibi fu; 1521; Shanghai Mus.). --DOA"@en .
