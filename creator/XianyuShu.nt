Yuan dynasty Early literati: In the early years following the reunification of China under Mongol rule, Chinese calligraphers concentrated on the transmission and perpetuation of the literati tradition from before the Song period. Important works of art, once in the possession of the imperial collections of the Jin (1115?1234) and Southern Song (1127?1279) dynasties, began to make their way into private hands. Scholar-calligraphers, now able to travel north and south for the first time since the political division of the country at the end of the Northern Song period (960?1127), gained access to these works. In the literary circles centred around Lin?an (now Hangzhou, Jiangsu Province), the capital of the Southern Song, the circulation of works by calligraphers of the Tang period (ad 618?907) and earlier fostered scholarly discussion and an artistic exchange that to a great extent determined the subsequent developments of calligraphy during the Yuan period. The scholar-calligraphers Zhao Mengfu (see Zhao, (1) ) and Xianyu Shu (?1257?1302), in particular, initiated a systematic and disciplined study of the ancient styles, which led to a classical revival referred to as a ?return to antiquity? (fugu) (see fig.). Reacting against the tendency of the Song calligraphers towards extreme individualism and personal excess, Zhao and Xianyu sought in the ancient models a more objective standard of excellence. This revival of classical works of the Eastern Jin (ad 317?420) and Tang periods marked an end to the dominant influence of Su Shi, Huang Tingjian and Mi Fu (see ï¿½(iv)(a) above). Zhao Mengfu?s intimate friendship with the northern calligrapher Xianyu Shu and their study and mastery of all of the major scripts in the styles of the ancient masters exemplified the new spirit of the literati in the Yuan period. Zhao Mengfu?s specialized studies and systematic analyses of the works of the ancient masters were reflected in his own mature calligraphic style, developed between 1311 and his death in 1322. During this time he achieved the ?grand synthesis? (da cheng) of the various aspects of the art of calligraphy; his works were not so much highly personalized calligraphic expressions as virtuoso performances, appreciated for embodying the ?flavour of antiquity? (guyi). His greatest achievement was his regular script (kaishu), in which he displayed equal mastery in the large, medium and small versions. The Record of the Miaoyan Monastery in Huzhou (Huzhou Miaoyan si ji) was written by Zhao upon the completion of the rebuilding of the monastery originally known as the Eastern Temple (Dongji yuan). Executed in large regular script (da kaishu), the inscription typifies the synthesis of Zhao?s mature style, in which elements of the calligraphy of Wang Xizhi of the Eastern Jin period and Chu Suiliang, Yan Zhenqing and Li Yong of the Tang period are apparent (see ï¿½ï¿½(ii)(d) and (iii)(a) and (b) above). Zhao Mengfu was especially praised by contemporary scholar-calligraphers for his small regular script (xiao kaishu). His transcription of Mi Fu?s Hua shi (?History of painting?; c. 1103; Lyme, NJ, Wango H.C. Weng priv. col.), for example, exhibits the balanced classical order and restrained elegance of Ouyang Xun and Chu Suiliang. Whereas Zhao Mengfu?s calligraphy is an expression of the sophistication and refinement of the southern scholar?official, Xianyu Shu?s compositions embody the northern ?heroic spirit? (gushi). After serving as a clerical official at the Yuan capital of Dadu (now Beijing), Xianyu was transferred to Hangzhou in about 1283, where he eventually retired. A northerner in temperament and physical bearing, he was much appreciated by Zhao Mengfu and the other members of his literary circle for the northern heritage that found expression in his calligraphy and poetry. Xianyu was especially respected for his connoisseurship: important Eastern Jin and Tang works in his collection, such as the Dingwu Orchid Pavilion Preface (Lanting xu) by Wang Xizhi, were made the topic of numerous artistic gatherings. Through these scholarly and aesthetic exchanges between northern and southern literati, a social and cultural climate was established that was highly conducive to a calligraphic practice that sought inspiration for innovation in the classical tradition of the old masters. Admonitions of the Imperial Censors (Yushi zhen; 1299; Princeton U., NJ, A. Mus.) is a transcription by Xianyu Shu of an essay written by the prominent Jin poet and official Zhao Bingwen (1159?1232). Inscribed with a slightly worn brush in large regular script, the characters were conceived on a monumental scale and conveyed an immediacy of execution that established their continuity with the aesthetic spirit of the north during its occupation by the Jï¿½rchen Jin. Xianyu could identify with Zhao Bingwen: both were northern Chinese and both had to serve alien rulers. Xianyu?s decision to copy this particular essay as a veiled criticism of the Mongol regime would not have been lost on his fellow literati. What differentiates Xianyu Shu?s calligraphy from that of his northern predecessors and marks it as distinctively Yuan is the stability and balance of his character formations and the clearly articulated relationships between his brushstrokes, which are executed with inner restraint. These features are clear evidence of his profound study of the classical tradition of calligraphy. Nowhere is this more apparent than in his cursive script (caoshu), which even Zhao Mengfu considered superior to his own. Song of the Stone Drums (Shigu ge; see fig. 98), a poem written some five centuries earlier by Han Yu (ad 768?824), was transcribed by Xianyu in the year before his death. Considered the finest example of his mature cursive script, it is written with tremendous vigour in a style clearly influenced by the calligraphy of Wang Xizhi (see Wang (i), (1) ), Sun guoting and Huaisu. A comparison between this work and Zhao Mengfu?s Four Anecdotes from the Life of Wang Xizhi (New York, Met.) brings out the differences in their respective regional styles. Zhao Mengfu?s characters are executed with great facility and a relaxed fluidity of movement. His curvilinear brushstrokes exhibit a delicacy and refinement of touch associated with the aesthetic sensibility and cultivation of the southern literati. Xianyu Shu, by contrast, invests his characters with a tense energy and strength indicative of his northern heritage, generated by the sustained control of his rounded and angular brushstrokes, which fold, twist and turn in all directions. While Xianyu Shu was greatly revered by his younger contemporaries for his personal integrity and commitment to the traditions of calligraphic art, it was Zhao Mengfu who exerted the most profound influence on subsequent generations of Chinese calligraphers. Conservatives such as Zhang Yu (1277?1348), Yu He (fl c. 1317?82) and Deng Wenyuan (1258?1328) emulated Zhao?s calligraphic style, with its references to the classical traditions. Individualists such as Kangli Naonao (1295?1348), Yang Weizhen (1296?1370), Wu Zhen and Ni Zan were influenced more by the spirit of Zhao?s ?return to antiquity? (fugu) than by his specific calligraphic style. -- DOA"@en .
