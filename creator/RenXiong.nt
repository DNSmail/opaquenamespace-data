Qing dynasty (b Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province, 1820; d 1857). Chinese painter. He is grouped with his brother Ren Xun (1835?93), his son Ren Yu (1853?1901) and his student Ren yi as one of the ?Four Rens? who dominated late 19th-century painting in Shanghai (see China, ï¿½V, 3(viii)(b) and Shanghai school). He painted several popular painting manuals for subjects such as ancient heroes, immortals and hermits. He introduced into his conventional depictions of cultural heroes a sense of metaphysical inquiry and radical self-doubt that provides an insight into mid-19th century China, on the brink of cataclysmic change. In his Zihua xiang (?Self-portrait?; Beijing, Pal. Mus.; see China, fig. 131) it is not entirely clear whether the figure is dressed as a peasant or as a monk; his bared chest is both defiant and feminine. His tonsure could be that of a monk or of a soldier. The inscription speaks of a rejection of idealism and a loss of identity. As a youth Ren Xiong trained with a local portraitist in Xiaoshan until he was expelled from his teacher?s studio. He began to sell his paintings in the commercial port of Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, where he met the scholar Yao Xie. Recognizing Ren?s talent for illustration, Yao commissioned an album of 120 leaves illustrating his poems. In Yao Xie, Ren Xiong gained a patron, the opportunity to view the paintings in Yao?s collections while living in his house and recognition from Yao?s circle of friends. Ren Xiong?s talent for woodblock illustration naturally attracted him to Suzhou in Jiangsu Province, a centre of book publishing and the home of his in-laws (he married the daughter of the painter Huang Zhu). When Ren Xiong discovered that the young Ren Yi in Shanghai was able to copy his works so successfully as to deceive buyers into thinking they were originals, he invited Ren Yi to Suzhou to become his student, by which he probably meant that Ren Yi was to assist him in the production of woodblock prints. In the process of engraving on wood practised in this period, the artist, in this case Ren Xiong, made books by painting illustrations and then engaging a craftsman to translate each painting to a sheet that could be pasted down on the block to guide the engraver. While the painter and even the engraver might command a reputation, the craftsman who provided the translation did not. Ren Xiong developed his figurative style from Chen Hongshou, another prolific book illustrator who brought to painting a temperament inclined to irony and social criticism, and a distinctive archaic linearity derived from the marks possible with the rigid tools of woodblock-engraving. Ren Xiong?s mature years were interrupted by the havoc of the Taiping Rebellion (1850?64). He was conscripted into the imperial army and served at the headquarters of the general charged with recapturing Nanjing, in Anhui Province. In August of 1856 Ren Xiong?s unit was defeated, and Ren went home. In the following year he died of tuberculosis at the age of 37, while engaged in illustrating a book, the Gaoshichuan (?The lofty hermits?). Ren was capable of both stock illustration and perceptive character analysis in a popular medium. As one of the Four Rens he represents late 19th-century art in Shanghai. Shanghai artists were derisively labelled Haipai (?Sea school?) by northern critics in the early 20th century, who contrasted the new modes of painting typified by Haipai, which engendered new patrons and touched the popular imagination, with the older canons of literati art, preserved in circles of artists who spurned professionalism. This criticism spawned a debate that continues to colour contemporary theories of 19th- and 20th-century Chinese painting. --DOA Painted landscapes, figures, flowers, birds, animals, fruit. --Seymour"@en .
