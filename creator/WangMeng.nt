Yuan dynasty (b Wuxing, Zhejiang Province, c. 1308; d 1385). Chinese landscape painter, poet and scholar?official. He is traditionally ranked as one of the Four Masters of the Yuan, with Huang gongwang, Ni zan and Wu zhen. He was the leading figure in the development of a type of landscape that blended monumental, powerful visual presence with complex, ambiguous structures evocative of mental states and personal situations. Later generations of artists painted landscapes in imitation of Wang Meng, creating an image of his style that at times has obscured his own achievement and identity. Wang Meng was born into an eminent family of scholars, artists and officials. His father, Wang Guoqi (1284?c. 1366), was a poet, calligrapher and connoisseur; his maternal uncle was the painter?official Zhao Yong, and his maternal grandfather was Zhao Mengfu, the leading painter and calligrapher of the early part of the Yuan period (1279?1368). Little is known of Wang Meng?s early life except that he had a talent in poetry. Family connections were probably crucial in his securing an introduction into cultured circles. Wang moved to Mt Huanghe near Hangzhou, from which derives his literary name, Huanghe Shanqiao (?Fuel gatherer of Mt Huanghe?), and embarked on a career as a painter, perhaps in the early 1340s, although no genuine works survive from this period. He also travelled widely in nearby areas of south-eastern China, including Suzhou and Wuxi (Jiangsu Province) and Songjiang (in modern Shanghai Municipality), visiting famous sites, attending literary gatherings and becoming acquainted with the leading writers and painters of the day. Wang Meng?s Secluded Dwellings in Summer Mountains (1354; hanging scroll, ink on silk; Washington, DC, Freer; see fig. 1) is representative of his early style. Features suggesting the influence of Zhao Mengfu (see Zhao, (1)) include the schematic river landscape composition, simplified figural and architectural details and the systematic use of ?hemp-fibre strokes? ( pima cun) for texturing rocks and mountains, a technique associated with the 10th-century painters Dong yuan and Juran. The centralized, frontal composition and rich, multi-layered spatial complexity are Wang Meng?s own innovations. Fisherman?recluse at Huaqi (vertical scroll, ink and light colours on paper; Taipei N. Pal. Mus.), probably of later date, is similar in style. Both works are preoccupied with the theme of reclusion and withdrawal, echoed in the stylistic retreat to a manner already centuries old. Wang Meng?s own attitude to political engagement is difficult to ascertain. There is evidence that he was a provincial prosecutor (liwen) in the late Yuan period; he may have had the post as early as the 1340s, serving the Mongol rulers as did many of his maternal relatives. His withdrawal to Mt Huanghe perhaps marked a severance of that service and a response to the stirrings of military uprisings that began to affect south-eastern China at that time. Wang Meng painted his most historically important and powerful works in the 1360s, a decade of social and political upheaval in south-east China, during which Mongol authority was displaced. He was often in Suzhou at this period?he participated in a literary gathering there in 1365, with Ni Zan, Gao Qi (1336?74), Yao Guangxiao (1335?1418), Zhang Yu (1333?85) and others?and perhaps, like many cultural figures, served in the rebel administration of Zhang Shicheng (1321?67) based in the city. Issues of loyalty and affiliation, and of involvement versus withdrawal, were particularly pressing in such an environment. Though Wang?s paintings of the 1360s have no overt political content, the political situation constitutes a subtext to his increasingly powerful pictorial representation of themes of reclusion. His landscapes of the mid-1360s share an exploitation of tonal contrast for dramatic effect. In reflection of 10th- and 11th-century landscape styles, especially that of Guo Xi, they have powerful, monumental mountainscape compositions and are preoccupied with the cycle of the seasons. At a time characterized by an intellectual, almost diagrammatic reworking of the past, Wang?s paintings derive their individualism from the investing of monumental themes with personal expression. Wang?s Spring Plowing at the Mouth of the Valley (vertical scroll, ink on paper; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.) probably dates to the early 1360s. There is a crowding of forms (to become more pronounced in later works), a soft chiaroscuro and use of the Dong Yuan?Juran ?hemp-fibre? idiom. The ostensibly bucolic theme is tempered by hints of structural ambiguities and the somewhat disquieting constriction of pathways through the landscape. These aspects are developed in Lofty Recluses in Summer Mountains (1365, vertical scroll; ink and colours on silk; Beijing, Pal. Mus.), in which the breadth of the scene, the complexity of subsidiary forms and pathways, an almost total closure of the background and a dark tonal range create an effect verging on the oppressive, at odds with the theme of quiet summer seclusion. Ge Hong Moving his Residence probably dates to the same period. It is notable for its explicit narrative theme, that of the 4th-century ad scholar?official Ge Hong late in life, after giving up government service, wandering with his family in search of alchemical knowledge, appropriate to the sense of uprootedness felt at the end of the Yuan. There is a contrast with the images of quiet domesticity of Wang?s early landscapes. In this painting the cottages nestled in a distant valley are cut off by seemingly impassable terrain, composed largely of angular and deeply undercut blocky forms unusual for the period. Wang?s most powerfully complex image of the natural world is his Dwelling in Reclusion in the Qingbian Mountains (see fig. 2), which reflects on many of his earlier concerns: family relationships, social and political upheaval, pictorial sources of the past and eremitic withdrawal. It depicts a site near Wang?s home town of Wuxing that had been a family retreat as far back as the time of Zhao Mengfu, and it was probably done for a contemporary relative who was forced to flee from a retreat in the mountains in the military campaigns of mid-1366. The image of a shattered family refuge is portrayed in a mixed style, drawing on both the 10th-century southern style of Juran and the 11th-century northern style of Guo xi. Deliberate ambiguities of space, light and structure emphasize the idea of landscape as personal expression. A Refined Gathering among Forests and Streams (1367; vertical scroll; untraced) portrays, in a more unified style, an idyllic retreat set before a restrained, monumental landscape. The scene is limited to a few elements?stately pines, regularly shaped central cliffs?given impact by a consummate control of ink tone. In Reading in Spring Mountains (vertical scroll, ink on paper; Shanghai Mus.) a group of similar tall pines and central cliffs is enlivened by the leaning of the trees. After Zhu Yuanzhang founded the Ming dynasty (1368?1644) and became the Hongwu emperor (reg 1368?98), Wang Meng served briefly as sub-prefect magistrate in Taian, Shandong Province. Literary records note that at this period he executed a painting of Mt Tai in collaboration with the artist Chen Ruyan. Wang seems to have moved to the capital, Nanjing, c. 1371, where his activities were focused for the rest of his life. His association with Buddhist monks in Nanjing is recorded, but no reliable dated works from the period survive. However, a cluster of stylistically related works are distinguishable from his better documented early- and middle- period works: Forest Chamber Grotto at Juqu (vertical scroll, ink and colours on paper; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.), Su?an Retreat (vertical scroll, ink and colours on paper; New York, C. C. Wang priv. col.), Buddhist Temple at Mt Taibo (handscroll, ink and colours on paper; Shenyang, Liaoning Prov. Mus.) and others. Characterized by a loosening of brushwork and pictorial structure consistent with works of later age, they share a rich texturing of forms with dynamic curling strokes and dots, a liberal use of colour and compositions crowded with relatively small-scale forms. Many depict studios, retreats or temples, often with Buddhist or Daoist associations. They lack the seasonal overtones and spatial grandeur of earlier works, as well as clearly definable stylistic references to earlier paintings. Wang Meng eventually fell victim to Hongwu?s paranoia, as had so many of his literati associates from the south-east. It was reported that he had visited the home of the prime minister Hu Weiyong, who was executed in 1380 for allegedly taking part in a plot to assassinate the Emperor. Wang was put in prison and died there in 1385. Wang Meng was the most prominent figure in a loose grouping of painters active in the late Yuan and early Ming periods, including Fang congyi, Chen ruyan and Xu Ben (d 1378), who depicted monumental mountainscapes crowded with dynamic and textured forms strongly indebted to 10th- and 11th-century painting. Wang?s version of the mode was the one most imitated by Ming (1368?1644) and Qing (1644?1911) artists. --DOA"@en .
