Tang dynasty (b c. ad 653; d 718). He was a member of the imperial family of the Tang dynasty and held various civil and military government positions, including Great General of the Left Militant Guard (c. 713), earning the nickname Great General Li (Da Li Jiangjun). The period during which Li was active was one of the most flourishing in the cultural and artistic history of China. Figure painting reached its peak with the famous 8th-century ad artist Wu daozi, while landscape was established as a major independent category. During this formative stage, Li Sixun was regarded as one of the most influential landscape painters. In his Lidai minghua ji (?Record of famous painters of successive generations?, preface ad 847) Zhang Yanyuan records that the transformation of landscape painting began with Wu Daozi and was perfected by Li Sixun and (2) Li Zhaodao. Although this is impossible as Li Sixun probably died before Wu started his career, it indicates the esteem in which he was held. Writing c. ad 840 in the Tangchao minghua lu (?Record of famous painters of the Tang period?), Zhu Jingxuan classified painters according to their ability and placed Li in the lower grade of the ?inspired class?. Zhu also related that Emperor Xuanzong (reg 712?56) was extremely impressed by landscapes that Li had painted on some palace screens and walls: he said he could hear the sound of water from them and that Li was the foremost painter of the Tang dynasty. An alternative version tells how Wu Daozi and Li were invited to paint landscapes in a hall in Datong (now in Sichuan Province). While commending them both on their magnificent attainments, the emperor noted ?Li Sixun?s achievement of many months and Wu Daozi?s work of a single day?, contrasting Li?s meticulous craftsmanship with the inspired spontaneous technique of Wu. This fictitious anecdote would have been forgotten had it not been for the influence it exerted on later critics of Li?s style. Written sources are the only reliable testimony for Li?s work. His paintings were copied at an early date, and no extant paintings fully represent his style. The unsigned hanging scroll Pavilions and River with Sails (Jiangfan louge tu; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.) was first attributed to Li by the Qing-period (1644?1911) collector An Qi, and although this landscape is undoubtedly early, it is impossible to substantiate the attribution. A cluster of paintings centering on the unsigned handscroll (Emperor Minghuang?s Journey to Shu) is usually regarded as typical of his style. The painting has been claimed to depict Emperor Xuanzong?s flight to Sichuan after the rebellion of An Lushan in ad 756. A painting of this motif was attributed to Li Sixun by Su Shi? anachronistically, as Sixun died almost 40 years before the revolt. Later scholars have reattributed the composition to Li Zhaodao. Certain features indicate that the Taipei version illustrated was based on a Tang-period original. The structure of the rocks is reminiscent of wall paintings in the tombs of the princes Yide and Zhanghuai at Qian xian, in Shaanxi Province, executed by court painters during the early 8th century; so too is the manner of rendering distance by showing figures half-hidden by hills and promontories. The swirling clouds fit the descriptions of the way in which Li painted clouds and mists, and the narrative richness is also typical of early Chinese landscape painting. The brushwork is, however, of much later date. Finally, the pleasant atmosphere of the composition is not in keeping with the subject-matter of the title, and it is doubtful whether any member of the imperial house would depict such a humiliating event. While no Tang source describes Li?s paintings as especially decorative, he was later renowned for colourful and painstaking landscapes executed in the Gold-and-green manner. In the 13th century the connoisseur Zhao Xigu was the first to connect this manner with the two Li, specifically with Li Zhaodao. The 14th-century writer Tang Hou, on the other hand, considered Li Sixun to be the first exponent of the technique. When the influential artist and theorist Dong Qichang developed his theories of the Northern and Southern schools in painting, in the 16th and 17th centuries, he selected Li Sixun as the grand ancestor of the Northern school, chiefly for the elaborate and decorative paintings that were said to be preferred by the court and the merchant class. --DOA"@en .
