Five dynasties (b ad 919; d 967). Chinese painter. His ancestors, members of the imperial clan, were natives of Chang?an (now Xi?an, Shaanxi Province), the Tang-dynasty (ad 618?907) capital. During disturbances at the end of the 9th century the clan split into two branches. Li?s grandfather, who settled in Qingzhou (now Shandong), and his father both held official posts. From 956 to 958 Li was in government service in Bianliang (now Kaifeng), at the invitation of his friend Wang Pu, then Commissioner of Military Affairs for Emperor Shizong (reg 944?54). Li came to know many important scholar? officials, but, despondent after the death of Wang, took to poetry, music, painting and drink. His paintings became sought after, but he remained at first socially aloof. Later he became a habitual wanderer, until, some time after 964, he accepted an invitation to live in Huaiyang (Henan Province), where he died of overindulgence in wine. Li Cheng exemplifies the Chinese phenomenon of a profoundly admired artist whose true style was, within a century of his death, obscured by unreliable attributions, the relationships of which to the original can no longer be determined. His fame was established early in the Northern Song period (960?1127), when critics considered his brushwork to have ?captured the miracle of creation [and] Li to have become the master of a hundred generations?. The Xuanhe huapu (?Xuanhe collection of painting?, catalogue of the collection of Emperor Huizong (reg 1101?25); preface dated 1120) states, ?When it comes to landscapes, Li Cheng remains unmatched in history or in the present day?. The outspoken artist and critic Mi Fu was ambivalent in his assessment of Li, whom he decried as having ?vulgar airs?with much skilful artifice but little natural spirit?. At the same time, Mi described Li?s painting methods in meticulous detail, thereby revealing how attentively he had studied them. In the Hua shi (?History of painting?; c. 1100), Mi claimed to have seen 300 imitations and only two genuine works, a four-scroll set of landscapes and another of pines and rocks; he was thus rejecting the authenticity of 159 attributions to Li in the Xuanhe huapu. The Xuanhe compiler had admired in particular Li?s brush-power (bili) and quoted Li?s alleged self-appraisal, ?I am a Confucian scholar who paints only for my own pleasure. How could people summon me to deploy pigments in their homes and to be treated as a professional painter!? Li Cheng was one of the earliest of the upper-class Chinese scholars who regarded painting as a private spiritual activity (a cast of mind and pursuit known as shidai fu hua). He took great pains to depict in detail rugged mountains, generally with a massive peak or cliff dominating the picture (see fig.). The critic Guo Ruoxu (11th century) ranked Li Cheng and Fan kuan, a student of Li?s work, as the absolute masters of landscape painting, and it was to them that two major schools of painting, differing in overall style and specifically in ink techniques, traced their origins (see Dong yuan). After Li Cheng?s death, the scarcity of his works, combined with the admiration in which they came to be held, spawned energetic and continuous production of forgeries. In the 13th century these specimens had become so common and so inferior as almost to obliterate Li?s reputation as the finest landscapist of his time. Critics such as Yuan Haowen (1190?1257), writing in 1234, lamented (inappropriately, for he was misled by imitations) that Li?s brush spirit was ?fragmented and confused, exuding an aura of the professional hack?. Nevertheless, Li Cheng?s iconic status among collectors and writers has remained relatively undiminished throughout the history of Chinese painting criticism. During the Southern Song period (1127?1279) the Li?Guo style (named after Li Cheng and his late 11th-century follower Guo xi) became an established stream in painting. During the first two decades of the 14th century, the Li?Guo style in its Yuan-period (1279?1368) transformation was introduced to Korea, where it became a foundation for Chos?n-period (1392?1910) academic painting (see Korea, ï¿½IV, 2(i)(d)); its reverberations are also found as far west as Persia in the landscape elements of miniature painting. In the 14th century Li Cheng ceded celebrity to Guo Xi, whose landscapes feature convoluted mountain shapes. However, the restlessness and turbulence associated until modern times with the Li?Guo school are probably wrongly attributed in view of the copious retouchings and inventive accretions inflicted on the works in the Yuan and early Ming (1368?1644) periods. The earliest observers did not mention the air of agitation that Li Cheng?s paintings reputedly exuded. Mi Fu wrote: Extraordinarily elegant and moist, the pine trunk is sinuous and straight, the branches and leaves create shade, the small woods and brambles show no redundant brushwork and do not coil like dragons, snakes or goblin spirits?. When making a tree knot, [Li] does not draw an ink circle but deposits a huge wet blob, then draws across the gap with a brush of thoroughly pale ink, looking as if made in heaven. Across are modelled rocks rising out of the water round and moist. From the peak the brushstroke plunges straight down to be level with the foot of the rock?there is a rock in the water, below which pale ink wash is deployed for reflection, creating gravel that sinks straight down in the water. This is unlike common imitations with their [confused] straight and oblique strokes that reveal no ground at the bottom, nor any water dynamics, [where things] float as if in mid-air, so that those who have not seen real autographs criticise Li Cheng works as having no feet. Mi stressed the sparing use of ink, the simplicity of brushwork and the straightness of forms typical of genuine Li Cheng examples. He also noted the insubstantiality and the excessive curlicues that were emerging among late 11th-century forgeries. Among surviving attributions, none is of the period. The vertical landscape Solitary Temple amid Clearing Peaks (Kansas City, MO, Nelson?Atkins Mus. A.; see Confucianism, fig. 1) represents what may be considered an anonymous late 11th-century view of the Jing Hao?Fan Kuan style. All other works in Li Cheng?s style depict gnarled, wintry trees or are landscapes inspired by Guo Xi. The rendition of earthen banks and desolate trees in the left upper section of Guo Xi?s Early Spring (Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.; for illustration see Guo xi), painted in 1072, fully a century after Li?s death, offers an indirect glimpse into Li?s manner, specifically the claim that he ?used ink sparingly as if it were gold? (see also China, fig. 121). Li?s son, Li Jue (ad 948?93), who passed the national civil service examination to become a jinshi, in 988 invited fellow historiographer Song Bai to write his father?s official tomb biography (muzhi ming). Li Jue and his son Li You both became well-known Confucian scholars and did not wish the family to be associated with the craft of painting, which had not yet acquired its respectability as a form of literati self-expression. Li You therefore paid high prices to buy back paintings attributed to Li Cheng, although many of them were probably imitations by his fellow townsman of Yingqiu (now Linzi, Shandong Province), the musician Cui Yuanshen, who had successfully mastered the Li Cheng manner. --DOA"@en .
