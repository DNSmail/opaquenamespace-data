Qing dynasty (b Shangyuan, Shengzhou (now Nanjing, Jiangsu Province); fl c. 1645?62). Chinese painter, poet, seal-carver and government official. Like many of his literati colleagues, he remained loyal to the Ming dynasty (1368?1644) after it had been overthrown by the Manchus and withdrew from office to live as a Buddhist recluse. He led a life of relative poverty, occasionally enjoying the patronage of the nobility, which allowed him to pursue a variety of scholarly activities. In his paintings he concentrated on landscapes, flowers and figures. A contemporary of the Eight Masters of Nanjing (see Nanjing school), Zhang remained an independent artist in the cultured milieu of the south. Initially, he was influenced by the painters of the Yuan period (1279?1368), notably Huang Gongwang and Ni Zan, and emulated their subjective expressionism and daring brushwork, as for example in Figure between Rocks and a Twisted Tree (1648; Hong Kong, Chin. U.). Around 1650 Zhang travelled to Beijing to visit the temples of the north. After he returned to Nanjing his main sources of inspiration became such painters of the Northern Song period (960?1127) as Li Tang. Zhang based his landscapes on the monumentalism of the Song painters, especially as they were interpreted by Tang Yin during the late 15th century and early 16th, and he developed a descriptive style that was massive and crammed with detail, as in Listening to the Sound of Autumn in a Misty Grove (1657; Cleveland, OH, Mus. A.). Zhang often appended the six characters ?Zhen xiang Fo kong si hai? (?To the true incense Buddha all is emptiness within the four oceans?) to his works, of which about 20 have been preserved. --DOA"@en .
