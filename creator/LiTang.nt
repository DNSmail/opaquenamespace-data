Song dynasty (b Heyang, Henan Province, 1050s; d after 1130). Chinese painter. Li was the oldest and most influential painter to make the transition from the Painting Academy of the Northern Song (960?1127) emperor Huizong (reg 1101?26) in Bianliang (now Kaifeng, Henan Province) to the Southern Song (1127?1279) court in Lin?an (now Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province). It was there, while in his 80s, that he introduced an entirely new approach that became the basis for the influential traditions of Southern Song landscape painting (see China, ï¿½V, 3(iv)). Li Tang apparently occupied no official position in Bianliang, although he was very highly regarded and held the rank of painter in attendance (daizhao) in the Imperial Painting Academy. In 1126 the Song court was forced to flee south from the invading Jï¿½rchen nomads, who ruled northern China during the Jin period (1115?1234). Before his arrival at the Southern Song court of the emperor Gaozong (reg 1127?63) Li took refuge from the fighting in the woods, where he met his future pupil, the robber Xiao Zhao. According to Deng Chun?s Hua ji (?Painting continued?; preface dated 1167), Li was already 80 years old when he left Bianliang for Lin?an. There he was appointed head of the Southern Song Painting Academy and was awarded its highest honour, the jindai (?golden belt?). Li Tang did not merely transmit the official style of the Northern Song Academy. He was an independent genius who continued to develop stylistically as well as technically throughout his career. Later critics claimed that he attained full artistic freedom only at the end of his life. The bulk of his work appears to have been completed in Bianliang, but he exerted a major influence on the new style of landscape painting developed at the new Academy, later referred to as the Ma?Xia school after its two most prominent representatives, Ma Yuan and Xia Gui. Li?s influence was twofold: his innovative use of monochrome ink in graded washes was especially influential for Ma Yuan, who modelled his rock and cliff structures after those of the older master; he also introduced a compositional format that reinterpreted conceptual space by presenting an oblique view of the landscape. This projected a diagonal thrust into the compositional distance in a daring, new, simplified organization of pictorial elements. In his Hua shanshui jue (?Secrets of painting landscape?; preface dated 1221), the painter Li Chengsou (c. 1150?after 1221) stated that the essential element of Li Tang?s ?change of style? was the way in which he rendered space through the balance of emptiness and fullness. Recognizing the importance of Li?s work, he went on to say that ?many men of ancient and modern times have reached a high standard as landscape painters ?Each one established his own style ?Many later men have followed after, but only Li Tang and Xiao Zhao have transformed their styles and in one swoop surpassed all modern and ancient men by their terse, light and swift manner of painting. They are, indeed, of the divine [shen] class? (Sirï¿½n, pp. 92?3). Li Tang?s creative versatility was readily apparent throughout his long career. While he is said to have painted in the more decorative and professionally orientated blue-and-green technique in his early years, there is no evidence of this in his later landscapes, except possibly in his somewhat mannered textural brushwork. However, as a mark of his favour the emperor Gaozong gave the artist the name Tang Li, implying that he was comparable to the Tang (618?907) painter Li sixun, the foremost practitioner of the blue-and-green manner. The graded washes that dominated his later style mark a sharp contrast with such earlier tight rendering. He is best known as a landscape painter, but he was also commended for his ability to paint other subjects. Ming (1368?1644) critics such as Zhang Chou equated the quality of his figure painting with that of his landscapes. Zhang wrote in the [Qinghe] shuhua fang (?The Qinghe boat-studio of painting and calligraphy?; preface dated 1616) that ?Li Tang was a good painter of human figures and landscapes ?he excelled even more in painting oxen, following in this the manner of Dai Song? (Sirï¿½n, p. 95). In the Shu hua ji (?Record of calligraphy and paintings?; completed by Wu Qizhen c. 1677) Li?s scroll depicting a scholar playing the qin (zither) is described as having a rendering so vivid that one ?could hear the sound of the water as well as that of the qin? (Sirï¿½n, p. 95). Li was consistently praised for his ability to paint rustic scenes as well as buffalo, both of which were popular themes during the Southern Song period. Unfortunately, the weakness of execution of some extant paintings of these subjects suggests that these may be later copies. Two of Li?s paintings are in the K?t?in (Kyoto, Daitokuji). They are undated and only one is signed. The paintings were probably cut down, which has altered the proportion of the original compositions, but the brushwork and asymmetrical composition suggest that they belong to the last phase of Li?s development. The signed and dated Wind in the Pines amid Myriad Ravines (see fig.) was painted in Bianliang and may be said to mark a middle stage in his stylistic development. In composition it reflects a derivation from the traditions of Fan kuan in a revival of the heroic style, combined with influences from the traditions of Northern Song monumental landscape painting and the introduction of a new and more intimate portrayal of nature. Moreover, Fan?s tradition of brushwork has been hardened into mannered patterns painted in fupi cun (?axe-cut texture stroke?) with a relatively stiff brush from which the ink has been squeezed out, known as cabi, which leaves the impression of diagonal stratification. While the earlier focus on a centralized axis is retained, it nevertheless indicates the direction of future developments. Li?s influence on the painting of the Southern Song did not continue into the Yuan period (1279? 1368). However, his use of ink and compositional devices?as treated by the Ma?Xia school?again came into prominence with the development of the Zhe school during the Ming period. Daijin and Tang Yin are among the leading Ming artists whose works reveal the depth of this revival of Li?s style. --DOA"@en .
