Yuan dynasty (b Wuxing, Zhejiï¿½ng Province, 1289; d c. 1364). Son of (1) Zhao Mengfu. Because of his father?s high position at the court of the Mongol Yuan dynasty, Zhao Yong was early given an official position and continued to serve as an official throughout his life, eventually as a military commander in Wuxing. He probably died during the last years of the Yuan period (1279?1368), when a number of rebel armies contended with one another for control in the area of his command. Strongly influenced by his father, he was an accomplished painter of many subjects popular with masters of the early Yuan period, including landscape, horses, figures, palaces, and birds and flowers, and he was occasionally summoned to the Yuan court to paint. Among his surviving works the most notable are a number of landscape and horse paintings. One of the best known is Secluded Fishing among Streams and Mountains (hanging scroll on silk, Cleveland, OH, Dean Perry priv. col.), which depicts a gentleman fishing in a boat near trees and rocks in the foreground that are separated by an expanse of water from mountains in the distance. Similar compositional ideas, some without the fisherman, are also seen in a number of landscapes, executed on fans (e.g. Beijing, Pal. Mus. and Shenyang, Liaoning Prov. Mus.). These show the strong influence of the 10th-century artist Dong yuan: long, wavy, hemp-fibre strokes ( pima cun) are used to texture the rocks and mountains. Among his horse paintings, the most interesting is Noble Steeds (hanging scroll, 1352; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.), which employs the Blue-and-green style that imitates the use of bright colours, mostly Blue-and-green, in Tang-period (ad 618?907) landscape painting, as an expression of admiration for archaic painting styles. A number of paintings depicting young gentlemen in red coats on horseback (e.g. Beijing, Pal. Mus. and Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.) also seem to try to capture the elegance of the Tang period. Although all Zhao?s works, including collaborative works executed with other family members show his versatility, he was always overshadowed artistically by his father. --DOA"@en .
