Wife of the renowned scholar?official and artist Zhao Mengfu, Guan Daosheng is also the most famous female painter in Chinese history. She is said to have depicted a range of subjects, including Buddhist figures, but to have excelled in monochrome ink-bamboo (mozhu). She reportedly created a distinctive type of bamboo painting featuring new-growth bamboo groves after rain. A composition of this type dated 1308, now mounted with other Yuan paintings in a handscroll belonging to the National Palace Museum in Taipei, may best represent her work. Guan Daosheng was also admired for her calligraphy. According to her epitaph, Emperor Renzong (reg 1312?21) collected an example of her writing, along with pieces by her husband and their son Zhao Yong, for the imperial archives, and remarked: ?[This] will let later generations know that my reign not only had an expert female calligrapher, but a whole family capable in calligraphy, which is an extraordinary circumstance!? (Weidner and others).--DOA Painter and calligrapher. Painted bamboo, plum blossoms, orchids, landscapes, rocks, and Buddhist images.--Seymour"@en .
