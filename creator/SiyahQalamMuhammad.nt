Lowrey; Timur and the Princely Vision: Persian Art and Culture in the Fifteenth Century, Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1989. (fl late 14th century or 15th). Name associated with a Persian, Turkoman or western Central Asian painter or painters. The full name, which translates as Master Muhammad Black Pen, refers in the narrowest sense to the inscriptions on 65 paintings and drawings, mostly of demons, nomads and workers, in two albums (Istanbul, Topkap? Pal. Lib., H. 2153 and H. 2160). Whether the inscriptions are signatures, attributions to a specific artist or references to a type of painting is debatable; no consensus of opinion has been reached as to when, where and why the works were produced. The two albums contain no introduction, patron?s name or date of compilation. They are known as the Ya?qub Beg Albums on the basis of the number of calligraphies signed by scribes with the epithet Ya?qubi, referring to the Aqqoyunlu Turkoman Ya?qub Beg (reg 1478?90). The latest calligraphy in one album (H. 2160) is dated 1511?12 and the first and last folios are stamped with the seal of the Ottoman sultan Selim I (reg 1512?20), so the album was probably complete by 1512 and had entered Ottoman possession by 1520 (see also Islamic art, ï¿½III, 4(v)(f)). The other album (H. 2153) is contemporary, since it also contains the seal of Selim I and several calligraphies produced after the death of Ya?qub, including one dated 1496. In addition to the Siyah Qalam group, the 546 paintings and drawings in H. 2153 and the 131 in H. 2160 include 14th- and 15th-century works attributed to artists working in Tabriz, Baghdad, Herat and Samarkand, as well as European prints, Chinese paintings and Ottoman paintings, presumably added during the reign of Selim I or later."@en .
