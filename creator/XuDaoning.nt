Song dynasty (b Chang?an [modern Xi?an], Shaanxi Province, c. ad 970; d c. 1052). Chinese painter. Originally a vendor of medicinal herbs, he initially painted landscapes to attract potential customers. After attaining fame, he ?frequented the manorial homes of princelings and officials?, for whom he painted murals, hanging scrolls and handscrolls. He was a familiar guest of the rich and powerful in both Chang?an and the capital, Bianliang (modern Kaifeng), in Henan Province. Famous clients included Huang Tingjian?s father, Huang Shu (1018? 58). Huang Tingjian later eulogized one of Xu?s paintings: I met Drunken Xu in Chang?an ? Quite tipsy, he would wield a worn brush dripping with ink, With the force of an avalanche, his hand never stopping. In a few feet, mountains and rivers would stretch over ten thousand miles, And fill the hall with a bleak and chilly air. A rustic monk returns to his temple, followed by the boy. A fisherman is hailed by the traveller waiting to ford the stream. (trans. M. F. Wilson) It seems that Xu was active in the capital around 1040. It is known that in 1042 he offended the prefect of Chang?an and took refuge in Huanzhou (now Huan xian), Gansu Province, but returned to Chang?an in 1043?4. Although considered vulgar and plebeian by the irascible Mi Fu in his Hua shi (?History of painting?; c. 1103), Xu was ranked by most early critics as one of the great landscape masters after Fan Kuan and Li Cheng. It was noted that whereas in his early years Xu had a meticulous and laborious style, he eventually developed an individual, eccentric mode of brush deployment characterized by speed, animation and compelling power. A marked use of wet ink was observed in his later paintings of desolate and cold northern barren scenes. Wen Tong inscribed Xu?s painting Wintry Woods: ?Although Master Xu studies the style of Li Yingqiu [ad 919?c. 967], in ink strokes he criss-crosses with abandon entirely in his own manner.? By the Xuanhe era (1119?26) of the reign of Huizong, Xu?s influence had become such that the descendants of his contemporary Qu Ding were said to have taken up Xu?s style and not their own family tradition in order to survive. The Xuanhe huapu (?Xuanhe collection of painting?; preface 1120) lists 138 works by Xu: themes include river fishing scenes, autumnal mountains, layered mountains, snow scenes, mists, woods and rocks, summer rains, vernal travels, cloudy spring mountains, wintry woods and returning geese. Liu Daochun lists Xu?s three areas of excellence as woods and trees, level distance ( ping yuan) and wild waters. He admires Xu?s vigorous, uninhibited compositions, which reflect the spirit of Li Cheng. Guo Ruoxu remarked on Xu?s abbreviated and highly individual brushwork, with which he created sheer precipices and sinewy, firm woods and trees. Yuan-period (1279?1368) writers, noting Xu?s origins as a medicine peddler, claim that his early brushwork had a touch of the common and vulgar, qualities that were shed only in his middle years, when his style became more restrained and abbreviated. They remark on his blunt and straight brush-wielding, with the entrance of the stroke exposed and the entire length a firm, straight-edged line. A handscroll entitled Qiushan xiaosi (?Desolate temple amid autumn mountains?; Kyoto, Fujii Yurinkan Mus.), associated with Xu, exhibits characteristics that may correspond to descriptions of his early meticulous style. However, for such technically correct works, in which the brushwork is self-effacing and hidden, it is not easy to identify the artist. The scroll?s relatively weak structure suggests that it may represent a work of the Li?Guo school (Li Cheng and Guo xi) from after the Yuan period. Its high vantage-point, close foreground, large crossed bare trees and tendency to block out the far distance all point to the perception of the early part of the Ming (1368?1644). An unsigned handscroll in ink on silk with light colours, Yufu tujuan (?Fishermen?s evening song?; see fig.), on the other hand, can be relatively securely identified with contemporary descriptions of Xu?s late style, though it lacks an end-section and the artist?s signature. The scroll possesses the hoary grandeur associated with painting of the early part of the Northern Song period (960?1127). The masterly and natural deployment of ink wash is typical of the Li Cheng school; the scale and the dwarfing of human presence, as well as the sense of a light source in the play of light and dark, all point to an early dating. The roughness and spontaneity of the masterly modelling strokes (cun) correspond to descriptions of Xu Daoning?s late style, as does the use of wet blobs rather than ink circles to depict watery rocks. --DOA"@en .
