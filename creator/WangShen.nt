Song dynasty (b Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, c. 1046; d after 1110). Chinese connoisseur, collector and painter. Son-in-law of the Northern Song emperor Yingzong (reg 1064?8), Wang collected old and modern paintings and writings about painting, thus acquiring a good knowledge of different styles. He also exchanged ideas about classical studies and aesthetics with his friend, the eminent writer and artist Su shi. He based his landscape paintings on two distinct modes: for the more serious and austere he used the monochrome ink style of Li cheng, and for the grand and lavish he took up the Blue-and-green (qinglï¿½) manner of Li Sixun (see Li, (1)). Both styles exhibited the then prevalent idea of expressing the artist?s personal interpretation of nature?s force and spirit. Wang frequently included tiny figures of fishermen and gentlemen in his landscapes as an indication of man?s position in nature. He often portrayed misty rivers and valleys with massive mountains in the middle ground and background, and in the foreground heavy, wrinkled rocks, to which cling dry, writhing pine trees. His rivers or lakes usually twist among the rocks and mountains, as for example in Fishing Village in Light Snow (handscroll, ink and light colours on silk, 444ï¿½2197 mm; Beijing, Pal. Mus.), though a massif sometimes rises from a wider surface of water. Streams with waterfalls rive the mountains and become mixed with clouds and mists, and trees are scattered among the rocks. The texture of the mountains is suggested by dark and light brushstrokes, whereas their contours are executed in forceful, long and short calligraphical strokes. In some of Wang?s coloured paintings the blue and green colours are reduced to a minimum in order to highlight the central massif and to avoid spoiling the basic monochrome setting, as in a Cliff Folds up in the Yan River (452ï¿½1660 mm; Shanghai Mus.). --DOA"@en .
