Qing dynasty (b Kuaiji, Zhejiang Province, 8 Aug 1829; d Nancheng, Jiangxi Province, 18 Nov 1884). Chinese calligrapher, seal-carver, painter and scholar. After his example, it became common for artists to attempt to be competent in painting, calligraphy and seal-carving rather than to specialize in a single discipline. Zhao was one of the greatest artists of the late Qing period (1644?1911), although much of his work displays a disquiet and unbalanced awkwardness that conflicted with Chinese aesthetic values of the time. As a painter, Zhao specialized in plant life. His early work is characterized by soft, detailed brushwork and brilliant, translucent colours. Plants of Zhejiang (1861; Tokyo N. Mus., see Tokyo kukuritsu, p. 162), a set of four hanging scrolls, is one of his early masterpieces: each scroll shows an unusual choice of plants and flowers and an immense range of colours and techniques. In one of the scrolls, the clublike arms of a prickly pear cactus are drawn in wet colour, with thistles added in ink while the paint was still wet; next to this is a complicated web of arched oleander leaves. Against this manipulation of wet colour, with its subtly vibrating edges, the pink and white oleander flowers are opaque. The fact that each composition is cut by the border of the scroll and that many elements within the paintings are interwoven gives a sense that the plants are reaching beyond their confines and enhances the vitality of the work. In contrast, the colours in Zhao?s later paintings are muted; there is an increased use of ink, and the brushwork is more exaggerated. Flowering Plants on Four Scrolls (1874; Tokyo N. Mus.; see Tokyo kukuritsu, p. 164) is a set of four hanging scrolls from this later period. In the scroll that depicts lotus and reed, the colours are dull greens, browns and pale oranges; the use of ink is abundant. The speed of execution is much more rapid than in Zhao?s earlier works, with the result that it is the intensity of the brushwork that makes the greatest impact rather than the vitality of the plants represented. Shen Fucan (1799?1850) taught Zhao empirical methods of research known as kaozhengxue, based on verification of texts through ancient artefacts. This introduction led to his fascination with stelae, which he first copied in 1863 after one of many trips to take the national civil service examinations in Beijing. The stelae had a profound effect on his calligraphy, which hitherto had been soft and rounded. His work acquired a new angularity, and his brushwork became more forceful. This style, which drew its inspiration from stelae of the Northern Wei period (ad 386? 534), became so popular that Kang Youwei identified Zhao as responsible for starting a mania. Towards the end of his life, however, Zhao was no longer concerned with assimilating the style of ancient stelae: his late calligraphy displays an angularity, asymmetry and natural movement unique to him. In a set of four hanging scrolls called Poems by Wu Zhen (undated; Tokyo N. Mus.) the individual strokes are blunt and plain, and the size and shape of each character vary constantly. Zhao has dispensed with the idea of distinct columns of characters and instead has fitted each character into its neighbour by expanding the size of the characters, writing them closer together and placing them on different levels. The brushwork is swift and uninhibited, and the overall effect is one of great freedom. Zhao?s early seals were characterized by a slightly wavering, uneven line that shows the influence of the conservative, archaistic tendencies popularized in the late Ming period by Wen Peng (1498?1573). By the late 1860s Zhao had developed his own style: his seals from this period are imaginative and varied in design, with great depth and power of line. In 1872, having put himself into debt to buy a position of expectant magistrate in Jiangxi Province, he arrived to find himself assigned to edit the local gazetteer. It was work that he detested, and Zhao?s dissatisfaction in his job coincided with the curtailment of his artistic activities. He held a succession of official posts until his death in 1884. --DOA"@en .
