Yuan dynasty (b Beijing, 1244; d Yangzhou, Zhejiang province, 1320). Chinese painter and government official. He was born in northern China after the Mongols had taken over that area from the Jï¿½rchen Jin dynasty (1115?1234) but before they had conquered southern China. As a result he spent his life serving under the Mongol Yuan dynasty, which ruled China from 1279 to 1368. From a modest family, he began as a petty official and was gradually promoted to become one of the highest officials at court. As a boy he had studied the paintings of Wang Danyou and his father Wang Tingyun, the greatest painter of bamboo during the Jin period. Their work led him to study that of Wen Tong, the originator of the literati tradition of bamboo painting during the Northern Song period (960?1127). Absorbing these examples, Li developed his own style and came to be recognized as the great bamboo painter of the early Yuan period. In his wide travels in southern China and in Annam (now Vietnam), where he acted as an envoy, he studied the many different species of bamboo and in 1307 completed Zhupu xianglu (?Bamboo manual?). Combining the study of paintings of the old masters as models with observation of bamboo in its natural habitat, he was able to achieve a new synthesis in this genre. Li Kan first travelled to Yangzhou on the River Yangzi in southern Jiangsu Province around 1281. Having grown up in the north, he became completely taken with the contrasting culture of the south, which still retained the cultural and artistic brilliance that had been developed during the Southern Song period (1127?1279), especially in Lin?an (Hangzhou), the old dynastic capital. He was particularly interested in the literati painting tradition and, with such northern artists as Gao Kegong and Xianyu Shu (?1257?1302), became an admirer of the southern tradition. He befriended many southern scholars and painters, especially Zhao Mengfu, and took up residence in Yangzhou, where he eventually died after having returned to the capital, Dadu (Khanbalik, now Beijing), for some years to serve at court. Among his surviving works are two handscrolls that were originally one, but which were probably separated during the Ming period (1368?1644): Bamboo (ink on paper; Kansas City, MO, Nelson? Atkins Mus. A.), which depicts two clumps of bamboo; and The Four Purities (ink on paper, 1307; Beijing, Pal. Mus.), which portrays bamboos, orchids, wutong trees and rocks. These scrolls represent the full range of techniques employed by Li when depicting bamboo in monochrome ink and his keen eye for the subtleties that differentiate the species. Many of his bamboo compositions, mounted as hanging scrolls and mostly executed in ink on silk, are now in the collections of the Palace Museum, Beijing, the Nanjing Museum, the Guangdong Provincial Museum, Guangzhou, the National Palace Museum, Taipei, the Imperial Household Collection, Tokyo, and the Metropolitan Museum, New York. Some show his technique of drawing the plants and leaves in outline and others exemplify his calligraphic technique, whereby such elements as leaves and stem segments are executed in a single stroke. Both types combine realism with the symbolic expression of literati feeling and aspirations, as do his paintings of tall pines (e.g. Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.; Indianapolis, IN, Mus. A.). Li Kan?s contribution to the history of bamboo painting lies in his revival of an interest in the literati tradition of Wen Tong and Su Shi in the early Yuan period and in his combination of the northern and southern traditions in bamboo to form a new tradition, which became established as one of the mainstreams of bamboo painting. --DOA"@en .
