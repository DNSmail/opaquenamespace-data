<http://opaquenamespace.org/ns/creator/Yujian> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Holden, Wendy; 'A Guide to Cataloguing Chinese Art', Visual Resources Association Special Bulletin No. 13, (1050138x). y35j26 Alternate names: Yï¿½-chien, ?? Song dynasty (b Jinhua, Wuzhou, Zhejiang Province; fl c. 1250). Chinese painter, calligrapher and priest. He was active in Lin?an (now Hangzhou), Zhejiang Province. At the age of nine he entered Baofeng yuan (Precious Peak monastery), where he took the name Ruofen and trained in Tiantai Buddhism. After his ordination he was appointed scribe (shuji) at Tianzhu si (India temple) in the Bei shan (Northern Mountain) temple complex near Lin?an. Ruofen Yujian has been confused with another monk?painter, Ying Yujian, from Jingci si (Pure Compassion temple), a Chan Buddhist establishment in the Nan shan (Southern Mountain) temple complex, also situated near Lin?an. Both men are listed in Tuhui baojian (?Precious mirror for examining painting?; preface 1365) by Xia Wenyan, whose account of Ruofen draws substantially on a description of 1351 by the painter Wu Taisu. The identification of Ruofen rather than Ying Yujian with the painter Yujian is due to the existence of this more complete account and its consistency with the kind of paintings attributed to Yujian. Yujian travelled widely and adopted his artist?s name (hao) after his return to Jinhua, where he retired to Yu jian (Jade Torrent), a hermitage he built by a remote mountain stream. He established a reputation for his ?cloud-mountain? ( yunshan) landscapes and for his paintings of ancient trees, bamboo and plum-blossom, the last influenced by Yang Buzhi. Only four of his paintings have survived and all are in Japanese collections. In the late 16th century, 15 of Yujian?s scrolls were recorded in Japan, including a handscroll, Eight Views of Xiao and Xiang. During the Muromachi period (1333?1568) the painting was cut into separate scenes, and each was remounted as a separate hanging scroll. Three of these survive: Mountain Village in Clearing Mist (Tokyo, Idemitsu Mus. A.; see China, fig. 111), Returning Sails at a Distant Shore (Nagoya, Tokugawa A. Mus.) and Autumn Moon on Lake Dongting (Matsutar? Yata priv. col.). These show strong similarities to a treatment of the same theme attributed to Muqi. Both artists use spontaneously executed ink washes to suggest the forms of the landscape. Yujian?s fourth extant work, Mount Lu (hanging scroll; Tokyo, Yoshikawa priv. col.), is signed and inscribed with a poem. It depicts the range of peaks that rises abruptly between the Yangzi River and Lake Poyang (Jiangxi Province). Only two of the scroll?s three sections have survived, but a copy of the complete design has been preserved (Tokyo, Idemitsu Mus. A.). Painted on loose-grained silk, Mount Lu is stylistically rough and undefined and must have been executed in part with a tool cruder than a brush, such as a straw reed or sugar-cane fibre. Yujian was an accomplished calligrapher. As a scribe at Tianzhu si, he had to compose and write all important documents dealing with the temple?s internal and external affairs. His writings were gathered into one volume, entitled Yujian shengyu (?Left-over phrases of Yujian?; untraced). Although praised by Wu Taisu as a master of the ?Three Perfections? (sanjue)?poetry, calligraphy and painting?he was neglected by later generations of Chinese critics, who considered his individuality too extreme. Although he had no lasting influence on Chinese painting, he was highly regarded in Japan, where his work played an important role in the development of Japanese monochrome ink painting (suibokuga). --DOA"@en .
