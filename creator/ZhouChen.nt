Ming dynasty (b Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, c. 1470; d c. 1535). Chinese painter. Zhou Chen was a pre-eminent professional painter of the Ming period (1368?1644), alongside masters such as Dai Jin. Zhou learnt a conservative style based on Southern Song period (1127?1279) landscape painting from his teacher Chen Xian (1405?96), who specialized in the ?plain-line? (baimiao) technique of painting. Zhou later taught Tang Yin for whom Zhou is reported to have worked as a ?ghost painter?, displaying his versatility. An example of Zhou Chen?s technically finished early style is North Sea (handscroll, early 16th century; Kansas City, MO, Nelson?Atkins Mus. A.; see fig.). The influence of 12th-century painting, such as Li Tang?s late works, made during the Southern Song period, can be seen in the strong diagonal composition and the juxtaposition of dark, intricate foliage against lighter eddies and whirlpools of the water. Similarly, the artist?s strict attention to details such as the outline of each leaf, the ?axe-cut? texture strokes ( fupi cun) on the rocks and the careful rendering of the figures are devices which properly belong to the 12th century, and they indicate the conservative tastes of Zhou?s early patrons. As Zhou became less dependent on Song models his style grew looser and more individual. Late Ming sources describe his brushwork as ?free? and done in a ?running manner?, a technique in which the brush is not removed from the paper or silk between strokes, so that changes in stroke direction remain evident and the whole has a cursive quality. An example of his later style is Playing the Game Weiqi beneath Pines (1526; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.). The attentuated pines that Zhou favours are even more drawn out, and the composition includes other characteristic motifs such as a traveller on a donkey, a servant and a figure holding a staff crossing a bridge. The water is rendered using the ?fish-net? pattern of undulating lines that accord with the texture and modelling strokes of foreground earth masses. In Enjoying the Dusk (handscroll, undated; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.), the traditional distinction between the manner of rendering natural elements and figures has been eliminated. Compositional unity is achieved by means of brushstrokes rather than ink tones. The painting is characteristic of Zhou?s interest in giving greater emphasis to foreground figures. He is not greatly concerned with the rendering of earth masses, which had been a prominent feature in works by Song period academicians and would be a major concern of later painters inspired by the masters of the Yuan period (1279?1368). Instead, earth masses are often broadly defined and modelled with dots of ink (dian) representing vegetation. The serpentine branches of the foreground pine trees are sometimes indistinguishable from the peaks of the middleground mountains, and their loose contours are echoed in the twisting shapes of the mist. Zhou Chen?s technical expertise and his concern for fluid contour lines appear once again in a set of album leaves (1516), now mounted in two handscrolls, Beggars and Street Characters (Honolulu, HI, Acad. A. and Cleveland, OH, Mus. A.). It consists of a series of portrayals of the poor and underprivileged whom the artist, as he records in an accompanying inscription, often saw in the streets and markets. In the original album format leaves were mounted so as to present the figures in pairs, emphasizing similarities in costume and posture. The drawing is energetic, the angular brushstrokes are ideally suited to the description of the tattered clothes and grimacing faces of Zhou?s subjects. These figures are not the idealized depictions of contented, carefree fishermen and woodgatherers typical of many Chinese genre paintings; they are sympathetic images of urban poor, a subject usually considered vulgar by literati painters and collectors. Perhaps due to the narrow taste of later critics and collectors, such images are rare in Chinese painting, and no other examples of such sensitive and skilful rendering of anatomy exist among Zhou?s oeuvre. --DOA"@en .
