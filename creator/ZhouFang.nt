Tang dynasty (b Chang?an (now Xi?an), Shaanxi Province; fl c. ad 765?800). Chinese painter. He was active at the Tang dynasty (618?907) court in the capital, Chang?an, after the An Lushan Rebellion (756). He painted both religious and secular figures but is particularly associated with the depiction of palace ladies (see also China, ï¿½V, 3(vii)), a genre in which he is considered peerless. He was reportedly of noble birth. His father served as a Master of Ceremonies in a princely household and then as Investigating Censor. Between 766 and 779 under Emperor Daizong (reg 762?79), Zhou Fang served as an administrator of Yuezhou (modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province); not long after, he held the position of administrative aide in Xuanzhou (modern Xuancheng, Anhui Province). From Xuanzhou, Zhou Fang seems to have returned to the capital. In his time, Zhou Fang was celebrated as a painter of religious subjects, particularly the ?water-and-moon Guanyin?, a version of the bodhisattva Guanyin (Skt Avalokiteshvara); most famously, he was commissioned by Emperor Dezong (reg 780?805) to paint the walls of the Zhangqing temple. As regards secular subjects, Zhang Yanyuan wrote in 847 that Zhou avoided all those pertaining to rustic village life, and Zhu Jingxuan, another near-contemporary critic, stated flatly that Zhou?s paintings of gentlewomen were unsurpassed in any age. Zhou?s painting style in this genre was closely based upon that of his predecessor, Zhang xuan ( fl c. 714?42). Although Zhou Fang is said eventually to have attained a degree of independence from his mentor, it is difficult to identify significant, if any, differences between the two artists; even by the mid- 11th century there was confusion between their styles. To judge from painting titles, however, it seems that Zhou Fang added degrees of subtlety and complexity to the genre: perhaps humour and drama in his Yang Guifei?s Pet Cockatoo Upsetting the Backgammon Board, or poignancy in his sketch Lonely Wife Playing a Tune. Zhou?s ability to capture the subtleties of his subjects? expressions and mannerisms is expressed in a well-known anecdote. An official named Zhao Zong had his portrait painted by both Zhou and Han Gan. Zhao?s wife praised both paintings but chose Zhou?s as the better, remarking that Han Gan?s portrait had caught only the likeness of her husband whereas Zhou?s ?conveys his spirit as well, and has caught his mood and the way he looks when he smiles and talks?. Important paintings attributed to Zhou Fang include Palace Ladies with Fans (Beijing, Pal. Mus.), Palace Ladies Performing Music (priv. col.; see Wang Shih-chieh and others, p. 3) and Ladies Playing Double Sixes (Washington, DC, Freer). These, together with the anonymous Palace Concert (Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.), though not of a single hand, form a distinctive group. The arrangement and interaction of figures are deliberate, defining the ambience of the environment. For example in Ladies Playing Double Sixes a small group forms a circle, creating an intense focus on the hands of the two players. As individuals, Zhou?s figures convey a very subtle variety of emotions and personalities. The range of expressions on the faces of the musicians in Palace Ladies Performing Music reflects a distinct appreciation for each performer?s approach to her instrument, and in Palace Ladies with Fans a mistress, leisurely seated at a dais with head on fan, is portrayed deep in thought, dreaming sadly of life outside the gilded cage. Ladies with Flowered Coiffures is the finest of the paintings attributed to Zhou Fang. In a palace garden setting stroll five elegant and beautiful ladies, dressed in sweeping robes of patterned silk and with lotus, peonies and cherry or apple blossom arrayed in their high coiffures. The last lady, standing by a garden rock and flowering magnolia, holding in one hand a captured butterfly by its wings and looking down at a small bounding dog, is the epitome of grace and delicacy. The painting illustrates Zhou?s fine, even-line technique spoken of by Mi Fu and the ?soft yet bright coloration? mentioned by Zhang Yanyuan. Although the description of the figures differs slightly from that in other paintings ascribed to Zhou Fang, details of dress and adornment favour an attribution to him: from the short, tilted eyebrows to the wide, flowing sleeves, these beauties exhibit the latest styles and fashions of the Zhenyuan reign (785?804). Zhou Fang?s influence was strong and widespread. Even in the early 9th century, an emissary from Korea paid high prices for Zhou?s paintings. Among the better-known followers of Zhou Fang were Zhou wenju in the 10th century and Su hanchen in the 12th century. --DOA"@en .
