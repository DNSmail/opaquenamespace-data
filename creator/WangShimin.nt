Qing dynasty (b Taicang, Jiangsu Province, 1592; d 1680). Painter, calligrapher and official. He travelled widely from an early age, accompanying his grandfather, Wang Xijue (1534?1611), on official missions. It was on one of these that he met the famous painter and art theorist Dong Qichang, who later tutored him in painting and calligraphy. Wang was fortunate not only in these propitious beginnings but also in being able to study at first hand works of the Song (960?1279) and Yuan (1279?1368) periods that comprised the renowned art collection of his grandfather. Among these were paintings by the four great masters of the Yuan period, Huang Gongwang, Wu Zhen, Ni Zan and Wang Meng. From c. 1624 to 1636 Wang was at the height of his fairly brief and unremarkable official career, becoming Keeper of the Seals and then sub-director of the Court of Sacrificial Worship. Illness forced him to retire in 1636, and, though summoned later to other official posts, he remained in retirement, painting, and tending his garden. During the 1620s and 1630s, as a number of dated works testify, the artist?s greatest source of inspiration was Huang Gongwang (e.g. Landscape after Huang Gongwang, 1638; New Haven, CT, Yale U. A.G.). Wang?s teacher, Dong Qichang, was so impressed by these paintings that on one of them he wrote, in 1627: ?Mist and clouds fly by, the forest at the foot of the mountain is dark and dense. It really is a poem in images. Thirty years ago I saw this landscape; now it stands before my eyes afresh. I sit in the pavilion and wonder at this extraordinary achievement.? Later Chinese critics, on the other hand, disparaged Wang?s work, accusing the painter of being so scrupulously faithful to his models that his transcriptions were, at best, uninspired and repetitive. Certainly Wang Shimin was less original than the innovative Dong Qichang or the more varied virtuoso Wang Hui. However, as is revealed by a much later painting in the Huang manner, Landscape in the Style of Huang Gongwang (see fig.), Wang was able to rearrange and transform past motifs, creating a landscape of extraordinary complexity with the simplest of means. Characteristic Huang elements such as flat-topped bluffs, mountain ridges and a dividing gorge have here been reduced to a series of repeated geometric units modelled and accentuated by rows and columns of dots (Chin. dian). Together with underlying contour lines, they are virtually the sole constituents of the composition. In one area, equally spaced horizontal strokes serve for the progression into distance of a path; in another, they emphasize the successive conical layers of the central ridge; elsewhere, applied more wetly and thickly, they become a cluster of trees: ?Wang Shimin?s paramount concern is in the brush pattern and movement, in the variation between light and dark tones of ink, rather than in the description of detail? (Whitfield, p. 40). The central mountain ridge follows the model of Huang?s Stone Cliff at the Pond of Heaven (1341; Beijing, Pal. Mus.), but whereas in Huang?s painting it begins as a mass of smaller units inclining to the right and then shifting to the left, buttressed by flat-topped precipices, in Wang?s painting the ridge becomes an uninterrupted bowlike curve topped with staccato tree trunks. The intelligence of the idea is striking rather than the brilliance of the art. The sheer number of paintings produced by Wang during a period of almost 50 years counters any notion that he relied exclusively on one model. In addition to Huang Gongwang, Wang cited in inscriptions on his paintings other masters such as Dong Yuan, Ni Zan, Juran and Mi Fu as sources for individual pictures. His inscriptions reveal that he was an accomplished calligrapher in the bafen (?eight-tenths?) style, an elegant version of lishu (?clerical script?; see China, ï¿½IV, 2 (ii)). Wang Shimin?s pupils included the brilliant Wang Hui and his less illustrious friend Wu Li, as well as his own grandson (2) Wang Yuanqi. In 1677 Shimin presented Yuanqi with an album of reduced copies of early masterworks that he had owned, The Great Revealed in the Small (Xiaozhong xianda; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.), which he had made when economic necessity had forced him to sell the original paintings. Dong Qichang?s inscriptions were reproduced on the pages facing the paintings. The album, with its many works in the styles of the ancients (particularly those designated appropriate models by Dong), became an important source book for Orthodox school masters. --DOA"@en .
