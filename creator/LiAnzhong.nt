Song dynasty The development of the visual arts in the Southern Song period under the leadership of the Academy was especially significant for Chinese painting. Gaozong reassembled the artists who had belonged to the Northern Song court and soon was able to reconstitute Huizong?s painting academy. Li Tang was especially honoured among the old masters: his name was the first on the list of members; he was made daizhao (?painter in attendance?) and received the traditional title jindai (?golden girdle?). Su Hanchen, Li Anzhong (c. 1117?1140), Li Di and Zhao Boju painted the traditional themes of birds, flowers, scholars at leisure and scenes of palace life in an attempt to recapture the glories of the past. --DOA After Zhao Lingrang's death, his style was still practised with fidelity in the Southern Song period as exemplified by an album leaf in ink and colours on silk, Cottages in a Misty Grove in Autumn (Cleveland, OH, Mus. A.), signed and dated 1177 by Li Anzhong, a painter of the Imperial Academy. --DOA"@en .
