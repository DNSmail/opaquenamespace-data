Tang dynasty (b Yangzhe [modern Yu xian, Henan Province]; fl c. ad 710?60). Chinese painter. Later known as Wu Daoxuan, he is a legendary figure said to have depicted human beings, landscapes, architecture, Buddhist deities, demons, birds and animals. Reportedly, he derived his inspiration from wine and had a mercurial, responsive brushstyle, producing breathtaking vistas of natural scenery and figures across vast areas of temple wall. Hearing of his extraordinary talents, the Emperor Xuanzong (Minghuang; reg 712?56) summoned Wu to his palace at Chang?an (modern Xi?an). Between 742 and 755 the emperor dispatched Wu to the Jialing River in Sichuan Province to paint the scenery. On his return, Wu stated, ?I have made no draft, but have committed all to memory.? He proceeded to paint the walls of the hall known as the Datong dian with 300 or more li (c. 150 km) of Jialing River scenery in a single day. Five dragons in the Inner Hall, painted by Wu on another occasion, supposedly had scales so lifelike that each time it was about to rain, they emitted misty vapours (the dragon symbolized imperial power over rain and irrigation). Contemporary accounts report that Wu covered 300?400 wall surfaces in Buddhist and Daoist temples in the two Tang-dynasty (618?907) capitals, Chang?an and Luoyang. Temples included the Tangxing si, Chang?an, where his masterpieces graced the Diamond Sutra Hall, and where he inscribed the s?tra texts himself. Also in Chang?an on the walls of the Cien si pagoda he painted Manjushri and Samanthabhadra and under the western walkway scenes of descending demons and coiling dragons; at the Jinggong si he painted the walls with scenes of hells, Indra and Brahma, and dragon spirits, and in the Yongshou si he painted the Three Central Gates with twin guardian deities. Wu is said originally to have studied calligraphy under Zhang Xu but became dissatisfied with his achievements and turned to painting. Perhaps because of his calligraphic training, his painting is described by contemporaries largely in terms of flowing, vibrant lines, that is brushstrokes rather than areas of colour wash. In the 9th century the critic Zhu Jingxuan observed: ?Whenever I gaze at Master Wu?s painting, I marvel not so much at the ornamentation, but at his brushwielding, which is peerless, always superb, exhaustively varied, driven with divine and untrammelled energy. Several walls are painted only in ink, and no-one to this day has been able to apply colours to them.? An old man told Zhu of how he witnessed Wu painting haloes on the two guardian deities of the Central Gate of the Xingshanji in Chang?an, with a large crowd gathered to watch. Wu picked up the brush and in a single stroke created a perfectly round circle entirely freehand; the brush seemed energized as if driven by celestial winds. The crowd was stunned and believed that Wu had divine help. According to another account, when the general Pei Min presented Wu with gifts of silver and gold, asking him to paint at the Tiangong si (Celestial Palace Temple) in Luoyang, Wu returned the gifts unopened, saying, ?I have long heard tell of the General?s superb sword dancing. If you would but dance for me once, the energy of your sword will surely inspire my brush.? Pei Min then performed a breathtaking sword dance, after which the painter grasped his brush and in feverish inspiration, as though aided by the gods, created a painting of unmatched quality. It is said that he afterwards applied the colours himself. These accounts indicate that Wu first executed images in ink strokes, and that the application of colour was secondary and perhaps less vital. It suggests a new approach to painting, in which ink is deployed not in a fine, even and draughtsman-like outline aiming at detailed completion, but in an expressive, descriptive and abbreviated style with strokes of undulating width. Unnamed contemporaries reported that ?the [ink] sashes on Wu?s figures flutter against the wind?, suggesting a swelling and shrinking in stroke width, with uneven individual segments imbued with a textural quality. This brush manner was eventually reflected, though probably subdued, in the figure style of the Northern Song (960?1127) master Li gonglin, visible in the painting attributed to him, Five Tribute Horses. Wu?s creative, varied and spontaneous brush deployment in landscape painting was the precursor to the use of modelling strokes (cunfa) that dominated landscape painting from the Five Dynasties period (ad 907?60) onwards, effectively replacing the use of colour in texture modelling. Zhang Yanyuan (c. ad 815?75) noted that Wu?s ?strokes and dots are not fully completed but are deliberately punctuated with spaces?. This method of rendering is used to indicate three- dimensionality and the turning of forms in space. Contemporary records indicate that Wu had a fully developed ink style with vigorous, spontaneous, ?leaflike? ink strokes describing rounded figures and imbuing them with remarkable lifelike presence and movement. He painted freehand, evidently without meticulous under-drawing or sketches, and at great speed. His brushwork must have been highly economical, with contour and modelling accomplished in reduced but enlivened brushstrokes, often combined in function, as for draperies or mountain folds. Later, ink-based painting with a sparing use of pale colours came to be known as Wu style (Wu zhuang). Surviving attributions, however, do not reflect such aspects of Wu?s art; paintings and rubbings feature studiously rendered figures in even, continuous and usually profuse lines. An impression of Wu?s lifelike images is offered by contemporary painted sculptures of celestial guardians in the Hokkeid? and Kaidan?in (Nara, T?daiji). His interrupted swelling-line technique is intimated, though in a paler version and without the mastery, in the facial cartoons created by earlier craftsmen on the H?ry?ji murals in Nara. A sense of his brief, descriptive brushwork in landscape is given by the mountain background of the plectrum guard on the biwa lute, a contemporary Tang- period piece (Nara, T?daiji; see fig. ). --DOA"@en .
