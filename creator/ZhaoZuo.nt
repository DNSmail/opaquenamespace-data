Ming dynasty (b ?Songjiang [in modern Shanghai Municipality], c. 1570; d ?Tangxi, West Lake region of Hangzhou, c. 1633). Chinese painter and theorist. Zhao studied painting under the landscape painter and calligrapher Song Xu and became the founder of the Yunjian school, one of two groups active in the Songjian region, near Shanghai, during the early 17th century (the other, the Huating school, was led by Dong qichang, the founder and theorist of the Orthodox school of painting). Zhao wrote a short text called Lun hua (?Discussion of painting?), the first surviving text on landscape painting since the Xie shanshui jue (?Secrets of describing landscape?), written by Huang Gongwang about three centuries earlier. The essay adheres to Huang?s concerns with dynamic force (shi), natural order (li) and the organization of mountain masses in long, continuous movements within the composition. Zhao Zuo?s text lacks the stern intellectual tone of Dong Qichang?s writing. It offers practical advice for the artist, such as how to sketch houses, trees and bridges in dry brushwork before developing the forms with wet ink, and includes advice on depicting figures, villages and temples, anecdotal elements not often found in Dong?s painting. Indeed, Yunjian school painting in general, and Zhao?s work in particular, is more representational, more relaxed and executed with softer brushstrokes and less dramatic tonal contrast than comparable Huating school works. The trees and earth masses in Zhao?s early painting (e.g. Landscape; hanging scroll, ink and light colours on paper; 1615; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.) are rendered with an appreciation for natural growth and geological form rather than as parts of an analytical system of representation using a limited repertory of repeated forms, as in many works of the Orthodox school. The Bamboo Monastery (hanging scroll, ink and light colours on paper; Osaka, Mun. Mus. A.) shows Zhao?s tendency to leave white bands of reserve along the contours of earth and rock, allowing him to suggest complex recessions in depth. He depicted rocks in a decidedly non-Chinese fashion, using varying tones and highlights applied in short, broad strokes to create a sense of volume and weight. Zhao avoided extensive use of ink wash and the long, schematic texture strokes (cun) commonly found in literati painting (see China, ï¿½V, 4(ii)). Consequently, Zhao?s landscapes have structural clarity and a convincing interplay of light and shade; the overall effect is painterly, soft and somewhat closer to Western chiaroscuro than to traditional Chinese formalism. Scholars have suggested that European art, in the form of late 16th-century engraved book illustrations, might have influenced Zhao. Between 1612 and 1620, Zhao Zuo became increasingly drawn to the style of the Orthodox school. Although his own work of this period lacked the originality of his earlier paintings, the qualities of his best work?the soft treatment of forms, smoothly flowing masses, occasional naturalism and deft brushwork?continued to appear in the work of Yunjian school painters until the early 18th century. --Seymour"@en .
