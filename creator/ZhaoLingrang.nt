(???) Song dynasty (fl c. 1070?c. 1100). Chinese painter. He was a fifth-generation descendant of Emperor Taizu (reg 960?76), founder of the Song dynasty (960?1279). Although such official titles as Regional Defense Commandant were bestowed on Zhao, his chief preoccupation seems to have been painting. His noble status allowed him a life of luxury and learning, but restricted his movements to the environs of the capital city, Bianliang (modern Kaifeng), Henan Province. Song critics saw this lack of physical freedom as bearing upon his narrow range of landscape subjects, mainly small, intimate views (xiao jing) of misty river landscapes. Though Zhao also painted small ink-bamboo subjects after his eminent contemporary Su Shi, it was through landscape painting that he gained his reputation and made his mark on the lyrical style of the Southern Song period (1127?1279). Zhao was a student of Tang (ad 618?907) painting, especially the work of Wang wei, the venerated poet?painter whose technical innovation of ?broken ink? ( pomo) contributed to the development of a more expressive landscape style. Zhao?s familiarity with Wang?s style and poetic sensibility may account for similarities that have been noted in the paintings attributed to the two artists. Significantly, Zhao?s contemporary, the esteemed critic?connoisseur Mi Fu, judged some of Zhao?s small snow landscape paintings comparable to works by Wang. However, since no extant works are securely attributed to Wang, and since literary descriptions of his style are vague and inconclusive, it is difficult to determine the extent of his influence upon Zhao. The most important painting by Zhao is the signed handscroll Jiang xiang qing xia (?Summer mist along the lake shore?; Boston, MA, Mus. F.A.; see fig.). One colophon is by Dong Qichang, the great Ming painter and connoisseur, who was an admirer of Zhao. The painting recalls aspects of Zhao?s work mentioned in the Xuanhe huapu (?Xuanhe collection of painting?; preface 1120): ?In his paintings there are the charms of low embankments and lakes, shady groves, vaporous clouds, ducks and geese: they have an air of spaciousness and ease.? From the opening scene the viewer is drawn in a continuous, relaxed movement through a rustic landscape; directional motifs include paths, meandering river banks and trailing mists. The horizontality and sense of spatial flow in the composition contrast with the verticality and spatial shifts in the landscapes of the earlier Li?Guo (Li Cheng and Guo Xi) tradition, in which nature is presented as monumental rather than circumscribed. Prior to Zhao, never in Chinese landscape painting had place and time seemed so palpable. The atmosphere and mood so essential to Zhao?s vision are conveyed by certain brush techniques: feathery, almost pointillist brushwork describes foliage and grass, and pale, transparent washes heighten a sense of ephemerality. A small landscape in ink and colours on silk (Nara, Yamato Bunkakan), representing a marshy river scene in autumnal morning mist, is believed to be a section cut from a handscroll by Zhao. In composition, it echoes a portion of the Boston scroll where a foreground willow tree gently bends towards the river?s opposite shore. However, perhaps because the season is autumn, the fragment has a more melancholy feel. Technique in the two works is also similar, though the brushwork in the Boston scroll is more descriptive of detail. After Zhao?s death, his style was still practised with fidelity in the Southern Song period as exemplified by an album leaf in ink and colours on silk, Cottages in a Misty Grove in Autumn (Cleveland, OH, Mus. A.), signed and dated 1177 by Li Anzhong, a painter of the Imperial Academy. This work could almost be mistaken for a work by Zhao were it not for the signature. Then at the end of the 12th century, Ma Yuan (see Ma, (1)) and Xia gui integrated Zhao?s innovations into their own style to create the dominant tradition of the Southern Song Academy. In landscape, this style stressed small-scale but spatially expansive views of nature; atmospheric effects; impressionistic and wet brush techniques; and, above all, lyrical mood. The essence of Southern Song landscape painting is unimaginable without Zhao?s prior achievement. --DOA"@en .
