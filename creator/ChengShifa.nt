Modern (b Songjiang County, Shanghai Municipality, 1921). Chinese painter and illustrator. By his own account Cheng was determined from an early age to become a painter. Although his father died when Cheng was nine, support from relatives enabled him to enter the Huadong (now Shanghai) Academy of Fine Art in 1939, where he was trained in the traditional disciplines of landscape and bird-and-flower painting. He also took an interest in the work of modern Chinese masters. Following graduation he worked briefly in a bank before joining the Shanghai Art Publishing Agency in 1952 as an illustrator. His assignments included New Year paintings and drawings for editions of short stories. Among his first successes was a series of plates for a contemporary edition of the 18th-century satirical classic, Rulin waishi (?The scholars?) by Wu Jingzi, which in 1959 won a medal at the Leipzig International Book Exhibition (Eng. trans., Yang Hsien-yi and G. Yang, The Scholars, Beijing, 1957). However, his most impressive early achievement was a set of illustrations for another classic, Lu Xun?s Ah Q zheng zhuan (?The true story of Ah Q?), published in Shanghai in 1963. While Cheng?s early work was influenced by traditional Chinese figure painting, his later study of woodcuts of the Ming (1368?1644) and Qing (1644?1911) periods, of lithographs and of Western art enlarged his repertory and sharpened his technique. After gaining a teaching post at the new Painting Academy at Shanghai in 1956, he travelled in 1957 to the Dehong Dai and Jingpo People?s Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, together with other artists. The trip influenced both his style and his choice of subject-matter. Thereafter he began to paint vivid scenes of China?s national minority peoples, applying line and ink wash with a Chinese brush on the colour-fast and durable Xuan paper (see China, ï¿½XIII, 20). His paintings of children and young women, often accompanied by animals such as deer, goats and camels, were the most popular (for example, Girls with Lambs, 1964; Berkeley, U. CA, A. Mus.). The positive themes of these works, in which animals and humans participated in a world of unsullied innocence and charm, were reinforced by bright colours, bold compositions and crisp lines. However, the artist?s imaginative twists and turns sometimes countered the innocuous themes. In Spring (1979; priv. col.), which depicts deer and gaily costumed women with flowers, the figures were painted on a blank background and the legs of the deer rendered with loose, ?calligraphic? strokes that are only marginally more representational than the characters of the inscription above. Cheng rarely applied additional layers of colour, the better to preserve the brightness of the hue. A fine example of Cheng?s figure painting from the 1980s is Ji Kang (1980; hanging scroll, ink and colour on paper; priv. col., see 1983?5 exh. cat., pl. 7), a portrait of one of the 3rd- century Sages of the Bamboo Grove. The sage is shown playing the lute while awaiting execution after having been condemned to death by imperial order. Few Chinese figure paintings of this date match the painting?s strength of composition and elegance of line. Cheng is associated by modern Chinese critics with an older generation of painters that included Li Keran and Lu Yangshao (b 1909). He is credited with giving new vitality to the Shanghai school through his understanding and absorption of the figure styles of artists such as Ren Yi and Chen Hongshou. A touring exhibition of contemporary Chinese painting that visited eight American museums and galleries between 1983 and 1985 (see 1983?5 exh. cat.) confirmed Cheng Shifa?s status as an exceptional figure painter and also as a fine painter of landscapes and historical subjects.--DOA"@en .
