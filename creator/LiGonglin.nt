Song dynasty (b Shucheng County, Anhui Province, c. 1047; d 1106). Chinese painter and collector. He was from a family of scholar-officials, possibly related to the Li clan who were rulers of the Southern Tang (ad 937?75). In 1070 he passed the national civil- service examinations to gain the title of jinshi, which in the Song period (960?1279) was the culmination of scholarly achievement and means to the highest official careers. Li Gonglin, however, began by retiring to his native district. Little is known of Li?s life during the 1070s. He was joined by friends in the mountains, and around 1076 went to Nanjing to visit the reformer Wang Anshi (1021?86). In early 1078, Li bought land in Mt Longmian, south-west of Shucheng, and began building a villa that he later depicted in a handscroll painting. A surviving copy of this painting is Shanzhuang tu (?Longmian mountain villa?; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.), one scene of which, ?Hall of Ink Meditation?, alludes to Li?s practice of calligraphy and painting as a means to enlightenment; there are also other versions (Beijing, Pal. Mus. and Florence, I Tatti). In 1079 Li left his mountain home to serve as an examination official in the capital Bianliang (modern Kaifeng, Henan Province) and shortly after was transferred to Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, and Zhangyuan, Hunan Province, where he may have met the artists Mi Fu and Huang Tingjian. By early 1086, Li had returned to Kaifeng and was promoted to a post in the Secretariat Chancellery. During his decade in the capital, Li renewed old friendships and cultivated new ones, becoming acquainted with Su Shi and his brother, with Wang Shen, Zhang Lei (1052?1112) and others. As collector, antiquarian and connoisseur, Li left his imprint on many aspects of art. The numerous extant paintings bearing his name demonstrate his versatility; in the genres of figure painting, horse painting and landscape, Li set a standard that remained exemplary. Among the paintings of horses attributed to Li, two are arguably genuine. Five Tribute Horses (see fig.) has no artist?s signature or seals, but the two colophons dated 1090 and 1131, written respectively by Huang Tingjian and Zeng (1073?1135), confirm its authenticity. The painting, following a type familiar in the Tang period (ad 618?907) but executed in baimiao or ink outline, a medium associated with the 4th-century painter Gu Kaizhi and in which Li was the acknowledged master, depicts five horses sent as tribute from West Asia, each led by a groom from a different country. One of the horses has been identified as having been sent to the Song court in 1088, when Li would have been aged 40 to 42. The painting disappeared in World War II. Pasturing Horses, after Wei Yan of the Tang Dynasty (handscroll, ink and colour on silk; Beijing, Pal. Mus.) was executed, according to the artist?s inscription, by imperial order after a lost Tang painting. A triumph of organization, it marshalls over 1200 horses and more than 100 human figures in an expanse of pasture. A comparison with the hunting scene from the Tang tomb of Prince Zhanghuai (d 682; reburied 706) at Qian xian, Shaanxi Province, shows how the painting corresponds to the processional paintings that were presumably common in the Tang period. Paintings attributed to Li referring to the classics and history include the Classic of Filial Piety (New York, Met.). This originally consisted of 18 sections, of which 15 remain, each with an illustration and a transcription from the Confucian Xiaojing (?Classic of filial piety?), written in the old-fashioned style of the calligrapher Zhong You (ad 151?230). Though also executed in baimiao, the brushwork is less confident than that of Five Tribute Horses; it has been suggested that the painting ?has the look of a first draft?, but a mistake in the prescribed number of bells for Confucian rites in one scene, which Li surely would not have made, suggests that this is in fact an early copy after Li. A Classic of Filial Piety (Shanghai Mus.) in five scenes with text in seal script (zhuanshu) is dated to the Yuan period (1279?1368) and is very similar in style to the scroll in the Metropolitan Museum. Even as imitations, these paintings are valuable as revivals of the archetype Li established. Li?s renderings in baimiao of other literary subjects, such as Tao Yuanming?s Returning Home and Qu Yuan?s Nine Songs, were also frequently imitated. Li also painted Buddhist and Daoist subjects, though none of these have survived in the original: a painting of Vimalakirti depicting the layman attended by a devi holding a flower is generally considered to be a Southern Song (1127?1279) painting (Tokyo, N. Mus.), and a long handscroll of Buddhist and Daoist figures (London, BM) with a colophon by the Yuan connoisseur Yu Ji (1272? 1348) is imitative of Li?s style. Li Gonglin established a canon of classical styles, based on the achievements of some of the greatest figure, landscape and animal painters of the Tang and pre-Tang period (see Barnhart). He is considered a master of the highest order: his classical learning informed every aspect of his painting. --DOA"@en .
