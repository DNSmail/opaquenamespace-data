Song dynasty (b Qiantang, Lin?an [modern Hangzhou], Zhejiang Province, c. 1155; d after 1225). Together with Xia gui, he is often mentioned in Chinese criticism as epitomizing the highest level of painting at the Southern Song (1127?1279) Academy centred in Lin?an (within the area of modern Hangzhou), Zhejiang Province (see China, ï¿½V, 4(i)(c)). There is no clear account of Ma Yuan?s life. He appears to have served as zhihou (usher) and daizhao (painter in attendance) under three emperors: Guangzong (reg 1190?94), Ningzong (reg 1195?1224) and Lizong (reg 1225?64). He was certainly a mature and celebrated painter by 1200. In that year Ningzong?s favourite concubine, surnamed Yang (1162?1232), was elevated to empress and thereafter, as a skilled calligrapher and patron of the arts, often added inscriptions and seals to Ma Yuan?s paintings. For example, the small, unsigned hanging scroll Solitary Fisherman (Tokyo, N. Mus.) bears such a seal with the name of the empress?s palace, Kunning, and a date corresponding to 1211. The handscroll Twelve Scenes of Water (Beijing, Pal. Mus.) bears a seal with a legend referring to the year 1222. This scroll also bears an inscription noting that it was presented to the da liangfu (?elder two authorities?), a term for the two heads of the military and civilian administration, further confirming that Ma Yuan?s art reached the highest official circles (the ?elder? was her nephew, Yang Gu). Empress Yang?s calligraphy or seals occur on a further important group of Ma Yuan paintings, including the two flower studies Apricot and Peach and Banquet by Lantern Light (all Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.), as well as on the hanging scrolls depicting 9th- and 10th-century Chan Buddhist patriarchs Yunmen and Fayan (both Kyoto, Tenry?ji) and Dongshan (Tokyo, N. Mus.). The date of Banquet by Lantern Light can be placed somewhere between 1207 and 1219, helping to further clarify Ma Yuan?s style in the early 13th century. Ma Yuan was a friend of Zhang Zi (1153?c. 1212), a wealthy aristocrat, official and sometime recluse noted for his elegant gardens and the lavish entertainments held there. In a poem for Ma Yuan, inspired by the painting View beneath Groves, which he had commissioned, he equated Ma?s passion for painting with his own passion for poetry. Ma Yuan?s paintings themselves, either by his hand or attibuted, indicate what motivated his art. His subjects are consistent with courtly taste: paintings described above depict evening entertainment in an elegant villa and is a flowering branch that might have grown in the garden of such a villa. The scholarly aristocrat in nature is found in On a Mountain Path in Spring (Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.). His relationship with Chan Buddhism is reflected not only in the portraits of Tang-period (ad 618?907) patriarchs, but also in his somewhat enigmatic treatment of ordinary subjects, such as the quiet huddle of birds in Egrets in the Snow (Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.) and the chilled fuel-gatherer in Through Snowy Mountains at Dawn (late 12th to early 13th century; see fig.). Confucian tradition influenced Ma Yuan?s Two Scholars under a Plum Tree (Boston, MA, Mus. F.A.), as well as two scrolls often attributed to him: Composing Poetry on a Spring Outing (Kansas City, MO, Nelson?Atkins Mus. A.; a recent hypothesis connects this painting with Zhang Zi?s garden) and Four Sages of Mt Shang (Cincinnati, OH, A. Mus.). The world of the immortals is treated in Riding a Dragon (Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.) or in the representation of the Daoist figure Lï¿½ Dongbin (Chongqing, Mun. Mus.), and the three sages of Buddhism, Daoism and Confucianism (Shakyamuni, Laozi and Confucius) were depicted in Three Teachings, a painting no longer extant mentioned by the 13th-century critic Zhou Mi. There are also paintings of more complete landscapes, notably Bare Willows and Distant Mountains (Boston, MA, Mus. F.A.) and the attributed Landscape in Wind and Rain (Tokyo, Seikad? Bunko). A recently discovered album (New York, C. C. Wang priv. col.) may further expand the range of this genre. Ma Yuan?s style is particularly characteristic. Words in Chinese criticism used to define it convey notions of condensed concentration: ?exact severity? (yanzheng), charcoal or ?burnt ink? (jiaomo) and ?squeezed brush? (jiabi). His rocks are described as ?square and hard? (fangying), and a sharp jab of the brush in defining surfaces, especially of mountain and rock, is termed ?axe-stroke? (fupi). His line might be short, broken and abbreviated; the term ?nail-head, rat tail? (dingtou shuwei) is applied to it, meaning a line that begins strongly and then tapers. Modern scholars have noted his use of a vibrant stroke known as ?tremulous brush? (zhanbi). A striking feature of Ma Yuan?s compositions is the emphasis on one corner. The earliest traced comment on this is from the critic Rao Ziran (fl c. 1340), who pointed out that most compositions considered to be by Ma Yuan were ?side-cornered? (bianjiao), although there were also ?complete compositions? (quanjing). It was the former, however, that became most persistently associated with Ma; in the 15th century the term ?one-corner Ma? appeared. In the early part of the Ming period (1368?1644) the court painter Guo Shun (1370?1444) attached political meaning to Ma Yuan?s striking brevity: ?the remains of mountains and rivers mean the partial peace of Song?. Ma Yuan?s style, along with that of Xia Gui, was a corner-stone for the development of the Zhe school in the Ming period. By the early 17th century Dong Qichang had identified Ma Yuan with a category of painting he designated the Northern school, connoting lack of individual spontaneity and scholarly refinement. In modern times this narrow view is greatly questioned, and Ma Yuan is considered one of the giants of Chinese painting. --DOA"@en .
