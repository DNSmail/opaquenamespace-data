Song dynasty (fl Qiantang, Lin?an [now Hangzhou], Zhejiang Province, c. second half of 12th century). Chinese painter. A painter of classical themes at the Southern Song (1127?1279) court in Lin?an, modern Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, Ma was known for his distinctive brushwork, marked by variations in hand pressure. However, the details of his life are obscure; sparse and contradictory information appears in different sources. A native of the Hangzhou area, Ma probably came from a humble family and did not interact with prominent men of letters, whose occasional poems and other writings might otherwise have mentioned his name. Zhuang Su records that Ma studied for the national-level civil service examination to gain the title of jinshi and that he rose to become an executive in the Board of Works. A competing tradition, originating with a list of court painters compiled by the connoisseur Zhou Mi (1232? 98), places Ma in the Imperial Academy rather than among educated officials working in the esteemed literati painting tradition (see China, ï¿½V, 4). The question of whether Ma was primarily a scholar?painter or an Academy painter remains a live issue. Despite the controversy over Ma?s status, connoisseurs have generally agreed that his peculiarly vibrant brushwork characterizes him as a follower of the Tang (ad 618?907) virtuoso painter Wu Daozi, whose use of broken contour lines and variations in brush pressure suggested three- dimensional form and kinaesthetic energy. Since the Buddhist temples in which Wu created his wall paintings were mostly destroyed by Ma?s time, it is likely that Ma learnt the style through the mediation of Wu?s Northern Song (960?1127) followers. Particularly influential to Ma?s artistic development was the 11th-century artist Li Gonglin, who tempered the extroverted Wu Daozi style with the introspection and elegance associated with such Six Dynasties (ad 222?589) painters as Gu Kaizhi and Lu Tanwei (c. 440?c. 500). Li?s revival of archaic subjects and styles also provided important models for Ma and his contemporaries. Connoisseurs traditionally characterized Ma?s brushwork as piaoyi (?fluttering and untrammelled?) and described his strokes with vivid metaphors, such as ?orchid leaf?, ?willow leaf? or ?wasp waist?. His variations in brush pressure create a sense of life and movement in landscape forms as well as figures, and his technique of layering an area with multiple strokes of different tonalities and thickness enriches surface texture, as well as suggesting volume and depth. The flaring and ebbing of his brushlines create an impression of calligraphic brilliance while also suggesting strong contrasts of light and shadow on three-dimensional forms. Ma?s style was perhaps too individual to inspire later followers, indeed he had no major ones. The subject for which Ma is best known is his illustration of the Mao version of the Shijing (?Book of odes?; see fig.) done for Emperor Gaozong (reg 1127?62), probably after his abdication. This consists of a group of handscrolls (New York, Met.; London, BM; Boston, Mus. F.A.; Kyoto, Fujii Yurinkan Mus.; Beijing, Pal. Mus.; Shenyang, Liaoning Prov. Mus.; and Shanghai Mus.) featuring pictures in ink and colours alternating with the texts of the 305 poems transcribed by Gaozong or his surrogates. The surviving illustrations are generally thought not to be the work of a single artist, although most seem to belong to the Southern Song period; it seems likely that Ma?s designs were executed in multiple versions by other Court painters. There are many different compositions, including archaistic scenes with figures on blank ground, figures in full settings and innovative landscapes without figures. Ma?s surviving masterpiece is generally acknowledged to be his illustration, in ink and slight colour on silk, of Su Shi?s Chibi houfu (?Second ode on the red cliff?; Beijing, Pal. Mus.). In contrast to other early illustrators of the subject, who followed Su?s text section by section, Ma attempted to capture the poetic flavour with a few suggestive images: the poet and his friends in a boat on a broad, moonlit river, a crane flying overhead and a prominent cliff. The flickering brushwork of the rocks and trees and the restless swirls of water masterfully evoke the poet?s emotional state. The illustration is followed by Gaozong?s transcription of the text in draft cursive (zhangcaoshu) calligraphy, with the seals of Gaozong?s retirement palace. Ma?s style is also exemplified by a pair of album leaves, Old Tree by Water and Cranes Crying by a Clear Spring (both Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.). In ink monochrome on paper, these display a rich variety of even more sensitive brushwork. Despite their current titles, they illustrate poems from the Shijing and may represent master drafts for the more formal Shijing scrolls. Although the tiny signatures on the two works may be later additions, the reliability of the paintings is attested by the seals of Ma?s biographer Zhuang Su, who was an important collector and connoisseur. --DOA"@en .
