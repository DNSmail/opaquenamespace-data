Yuan dynasty (b Fangshan, Beijing, 1248; d 1310). Chinese painter, poet and government official. Of Muslim Uygur descent, he was the eldest of five sons from a family that combined Muslim and Han cultures and enjoyed favourable social status when the Mongols ruled China as the Yuan dynasty (1279?1368). From an early age he was taught by his father, a highly respected Confucian scholar who instructed Gao in the Chinese classics, preparing him well for government service. Gao began his service in the Yuan government at the age of 27, eventually achieving the high rank of governor and a minister of justice. In addition to serving at the court in Dadu (Khanbalik, now Beijing), he held various positions in many parts of China, including Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. While serving in the River Yangzi delta area, Gao became acquainted with many of the painters and poets of that southern region; these included other northern literati who also served in the south, such as Li Kan, Xianyu Shu (1257?1302) and Li Zhongfang ( fl c. 1245?1320). One of his close friends was the leading painter and calligrapher Zhao Mengfu, a southerner who served the Mongols both in the south and at the court in Beijing. As a northerner, Gao developed his art mainly from the literati tradition of the Northern Song period (960?1127), especially from the landscape painting of Mi Fu and the bamboo painting of Su Shi. As a result he held a special position in the art of the Yuan period, transmitting the landscape painting tradition begun by Mi Fu to the Yuan and later periods and encouraging its introduction into the southern areas of China. Gao?s two best-known works are Clearing after a Spring Rain in the Mountains (hanging scroll, ink on silk; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.), which has an inscription by Li Kan dated 1299, and Clouds Encircling Luxuriant Peaks (hanging scroll, ink on silk; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.), also with an inscription by Li Kan but dated 1309. While the former reflects Gao?s earlier manner, when he was still attempting to solve the problems of the Mi Fu tradition, the latter represents his maturity. It demonstrates the transformation of the monumental landscape typical of the Northern Song period into a style that is both more characteristic of Yuan period painting and representative of Gao?s individual contribution to it. His bamboo painting style is exemplified by Bamboo and Rock (hanging scroll, ink on silk; Beijing, Pal. Mus.), which is inscribed with a poem by Zhao Mengfu and includes rocks executed in the long ?hemp-fibre? brushstrokes ( pima cun), derived from Dong Yuan, that were commonly used by literati painters of the Yuan period.-- DOA"@en .
