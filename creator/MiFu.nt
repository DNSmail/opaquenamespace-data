Song dynasty (1) Mi Fu [Mi Fei; zi Yuanzhang, hao Nangong, Lumen Jushi, Xiangyang Manshi, Haiyue Waishi] (b Xiangyang, Hubei Province, 1051; d Huaiyang, Jiangsu Province, 1107). He was an influential calligrapher whose critical assessments and connoisseurship contributed to Chinese aesthetic scholarship. None of his paintings survive, but authenticated copies display an independence of vision greatly admired and frequently imitated. A dedicated antiquarian, he exemplified the Chinese ideal of integrating scholarship, aesthetics and official life. Mi came from a family of cultured, landowning aristocrats and grew up familiar with court life. He began his collection of old calligraphy and paintings as a youth and throughout his life sought to upgrade its quality. He was also an individualist and the subject of numerous anecdotes: his reputation for cleanliness was proverbial. He immersed himself in the study of the past and even wore clothes from the Tang period (ad 618?907). He apparently never took official examinations but nonetheless received numerous governmental appointments, perhaps because of his mother?s former position as wetnurse to the empress Yongsong (reg c. second third of the 11th century). He took advantage of posts throughout the country to study landscape and art collections. When the emperor Huizong (reg 1101?25) founded a college of painting and calligraphy in 1104, Mi was appointed its head (see China, ï¿½V, 4(i)(c)). Mi Fu made an extremely thorough study of ancient paintings and calligraphy, and his publications on these subjects are among the most important in the history of Chinese art theory. The Baozheng daifeng lu (?Records of searches for precious scrolls?; preface dated 1086) presents astute, though fairly conventional, analyses and assessments of early works and reflects his own poetic ability. The practical advice it gives about the care of scrolls is still commonly accepted. In his Hua shi (?History of painting?) his commentaries about contemporary works are merciless. He presented no fixed rules or classification for the appreciation of painting but based his judgements on his personal aesthetic response to individual works. He felt that the most important quality in a work of art was its naturalness (Chin. tianzhen): not the realism of the image, but rather an artlessness and innocence of content and execution. In keeping with literati theory, his assessments were not confined to form and style but were also concerned with the moral quality of the artist reflected in the work of art (see China, ï¿½V, 4(ii)). He considered landscapes to be the only subject really worthy of classification as a creative art: landscapes ?possess inexhaustible delights, particularly when they have haze, clouds and mist effects; they are beautiful? (Sirï¿½n, p. 34). This description fits his own compositional format. By the time he was 30 Mi had won recognition both as a critic and as a calligrapher. Indeed, he is listed as a calligrapher rather than a painter in the Xuanhe huapu (preface dated 1120), the catalogue of the imperial collection. He is generally classified as one of the Four Great Calligraphers of the Northern Song (960?1127), along with his good friend and mentor, Su Shi, Su?s disciple Huang Tingjian and Cai Xiang (see China, ï¿½IV, 2(iv)). Mi was proficient in numerous scripts, and many signed examples of his calligraphy still exist. These are much more easily authenticated than his paintings, for he usually signed his calligraphy. Su Shi advised him to study the calligraphy of the Eastern Jin (ad 317?420) masters, such as Wang Xizhi (see Wang (i), (1) ) in order to attain their ?classical elevation?, and he also studied the Tang masters, including Yan zhenqing, Liu Gongquan (ad 778?865), Ouyang xun and Chu suiliang. His early work was criticized as imitative, but he quickly developed his own cursive interpretations, combining structural discipline with an unprecedented level of technical proficiency in brushwork. His large seal script (da zhuanshu) is directly derived from bronze inscriptions but nonetheless emphasizes brushwork over structure. Of the Four Great Calligraphers he was the only one to write in clerical script (lishu); he executed it using his customary running stroke technique, however, with the result that it is not considered equal to his other scripts. He had a distinctive manner of executing the grass radical element of a character with alternating horizontal and vertical strokes. Mi?s running script (xingshu), his best-known style, had a plump brushwork that has been described as making ?one think of a striking tubby figure walking along a road? (1961 exh. cat., p. 82; see China, fig. 94). The dashing quality of Mi?s other scripts led Su Shi to comment ?like sailing in the wind and riding a horse into battle, his writing is exhilarating?. Huang Tingjian made a similar comparison, ?like a sharp knife in battle, or an arrow in flight, what it touches must be pierced?; and Mi Fu himself described his approach thus, ?other people write with one side [of the brush], I write with four sides? (all 1971 exh. cat., p. 22). In so saying he explained that he used the brush as a painter rather than a calligrapher, exploiting every possibility of the flexibility of the line as well as the subtle nuances of ink tones. Mi?s calligraphy was greatly admired in the Ming period (1368?1644) and was copied by such artists as Wen Zhengming (see Wen, (1)), Zhu yunming and Dong qichang. Records indicate that Mi Fu did not begin to paint until the last years of his life. He has been said to have painted portraits and figures in the tradition of Li Gonglin, but it was primarily as a landscape painter that he was known and was most influential (see China, ï¿½V, 3(iv)(a)). His output was modest, and by the Southern Song period (1127?1279) examples were already extremely rare. He was nonetheless considered one of the most important representatives of the Southern school of landscape painting and credited with being one of the first of the literati to paint landscapes. He introduced new ideas into literati painting (shidaifu hua or wenren hua), emphasizing the character of the artist as revealed in the painting rather than the subject or composition. He developed a distinctive painting technique known as Mi dian cun (?Mi?s dotting technique?), which was also used by his son, Mi Youren, but which has survived only in later imitations. The strokes are formed by laying down the side of the brush approximately parallel to the bottom of the paper. The result is an impressionistic overlaying of ink washes in graded tones that produces a soft and misty effect with a minimum of structured form and draughtsmanship. This style can only be achieved on paper and sometimes requires tools other than the traditional brush. The paintings are small and composed of rhythmically patterned forms that stress rounded, cone-shaped hills rising out of heavily obscuring mists. Mi?s style of painting was influential during the Yuan period (1279?1368); it can be seen in the work of Gao kegong, Fang congyi and others. While the general characteristics of Mi?s innovations can be seen in copies of his works, some of the traits that are re-created in some copies are not present in others. For example, one small scroll generally accepted as representing his principles is Auspicious Pine-trees in the Spring Mountains (Chunshan ruisong tu; see fig.). The impressionistic quality and use of heavily obscuring mists and patterned conical mountain forms are typical of Mi?s style, as are the limited use of linear elements and the rootless trees. The colours also are consistent with those used by Mi and his eldest son, Mi Youren (see (2) below), although the particular colour scheme appears to be an innovation of the Yuan period. An accompanying calligraphic inscription by the emperor Gaozong is no criterion of authenticity. -- Seymour"@en .
