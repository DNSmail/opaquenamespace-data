Yuan dynasty (b Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, ?1331; d 1371). Chinese painter and scholar. He grew up in the Lake Tai region of Jiangsu Province, the area around which literati artists of the Yuan (1279?1368) and early Ming (1368?1644) periods were active. The Yuan dynasty was in decline, attended by political turmoil and military strife, and Chen served in military and civil positions first under the rebel leader Zhang Shicheng and then under Zhu Yuanzhang, the founder and first emperor (Hongwu, reg 1368?98) of the Ming dynasty. Chen?s painting career spanned barely two decades; he was not prolific, but his small corpus of extant works presents a well-focused image of the range and style and expression available to a scholar?painter in the Suzhou area from the late 1350s to the early 1370s. Chen?s earliest extant work, Picture of the Jing River ( Jing xi tu; hanging scroll, ink on silk; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.), executed when he was not yet 30, was commissioned with specific requirements. Painted for the Wang family, recently displaced from their villa by the Jing River because of rebel fighting, the scroll presents a panoramic composition using long hemp-fibre texture strokes ( pima cun) and schematic yet literal architectural detail. Chen is cited as the painter of this nostalgic portrayal (though he did not sign it) in an inscription of 1359 by one of the Four Masters of the Yuan period, Ni Zan, a friend of the Chen family. Chen was pursuing his official duties, probably in Hangzhou, under worsening threat from rival armies when he painted Woodcutter of Mt Luofu (Luofu shan qiao tu; hanging scroll, ink on silk; Cleveland, OH, Dean Perry priv. col.). Unlike his early works, which depicted local sites, this was an idealized landscape in which Chen employed his characteristic hemp-fibre texture strokes to represent the distant mountain. Mt Luofu, in Guangdong Province, was linked in popular myth with the floating paradise of Penglai, the land of the Daoist immortals, supposed to be situated on the coast of the province. The woodcutter theme was a traditional image of withdrawal. Chen Ruyan was executed for unspecified political offences in the autumn of 1371. A brief eulogy inscribed by Ni Zan in the 12th month of that year on Chen?s Land of Immortals (Xianshan tu; handscroll, ink and colour on silk; Cleveland, OH, Dean Perry priv. col.) cites as Chen?s source the early Yuan artist Zhao Mengfu, whose works Chen may have seen during his official stay in Wuxing and Hangzhou, in Zhejiang Province. In this vision of paradise, Chen employed the blue- and-green palette of mineral colours first used in the Tang period (ad 618?907) together with long fibrous strokes that textured the undulating mountain forms. Chen Ruyan?s descendants continued the family tradition of scholarship into the 15th century. His son Chen Ji (1370?1434) and grandson Chen Kuan (1398?after 1467) figured prominently in Suzhou?s intellectual circles, and Chen Kuan was one of the principal teachers of the young Shen zhou.--DOA"@en .
