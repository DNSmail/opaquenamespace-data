Tang dynasty (b Wannian, Yongzhou [now Xi?an], Shaanxi Province, c. ad 600; d 673). Chinese painter and government official. He is the most famous painter associated with the imperial courts of the emperors Taizong (reg ad 626?49) and Gaozong (reg 649?83) and the most notable of the few Chinese court painters to attain exceptional official rank. He helped define the imperial taste of the Tang dynasty (618?907), depicting figures and narrative subjects in a detailed, colourful and realistic style. Yan Liben?s father, Yan Bi (563?613), born into an important aristocratic family of the Northern Wei and married to a daughter of the Northern Zhou emperor Wudi (reg 561?77), was himself a painter and calligrapher, who earned a place as designer, engineer and architect at the Sui- dynasty (581?618) court. Yan Liben?s elder brother, Yan Lide (d 656), attained the important posts of Director of the Directorate for Palace Buildings and President of the Board of Works (c. 648). Yan Liben followed his brother in these posts and then rose to become Chief Minister of the Right in 668 and Director of the Secretariat in 671, important and influential offices involved with the formulation of government policy. Yan Liben was trained as an artist at an early age. In 626 he had the important commission of painting portraits of the 18 scholars at the court of the prince who later became Taizong. In 643 he painted portraits of 24 meritorious officials for the Lingyan Pavilion (four of these survive in the form of Northern Song (960?1127) rubbings; Beijing, Cent. Acad. A. & Des.). He also painted religious subjects, as confirmed by his inclusion in the category of painters of Buddhist and Daoist subjects in the Xuanhe huapu (?Xuanhe collection of painting?; preface 1120). He modelled his style on that of Zhang Sengyou ( fl c. 500?50) and was noted for his ability to capture the true appearance of things. Thus he was ordered by Taizong to portray the foreign tribute bearers arriving at court (for an illustration of tribute bearers attributed to Yan Liben, see China, fig. 132), as well as Prince Guo (younger brother of Taizong) heroically killing a murderous dark tiger with a single bow shot. According to anecdote, Yan was once hurriedly called forth by Taizong to crouch by a lake and paint some unusual birds bobbing in the water that the emperor found particularly delightful. Apparently, Yan was greatly humiliated by the experience and warned his sons never to become painters. An example of Chinese historiographers? traditional bias against painters and artisans, this story, with its moral message, became indelibly linked with Yan Liben?s later image. Of the extant works attributed to Yan, Thirteen Emperors (handscroll, ink and colours on silk; Boston, MA, Mus. F.A.; see China, fig. 128) is the best-known and the finest. It portrays 13 emperors ranging from the Han (206 bc?ad 220) to Sui dynasties, with identifying titles above. The latter seven are considered to be earlier and of better quality than the first six, though even the seven may represent a portion of a mid-11th-century copy of an original painted not by Yan but by another 7th-century artist, Lang Yuling. Palanquin Bearers (see fig.) depicts the meeting of the Tibetan envoy Lu Dongzan with Emperor Taizong (borne on a palanquin by nine maidens). It is also considered to be a mid-11th-century copy, but the attribution of the composition to Yan is slightly more secure. In both paintings, the figures are meticulously delineated with ?iron wire? lines, following an earlier tradition best exemplified by the Eastern Jin (ad 317?420) painter Gu kaizhi, but they also exhibit a concern for subtle volumetric modelling. A lively sense of design, capturing the atmosphere of court pageantry, is particularly pronounced in the portrayal of Taizong?s entourage in Palanquin Bearers. Personality and mood are aptly expressed in individual faces and gestures, in accordance with Yan?s reported talent for portraying true appearances. --DOA"@en .
