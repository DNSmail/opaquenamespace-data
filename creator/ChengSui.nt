Ming dynasty Cheng came from a prosperous Shexian family and painted chiefly for his own pleasure, beginning late in life; genuine works by him are relatively scarce. His undated 'Landscape' is an especially fine example; like a work of calligraphy or a seal, it arranges small, formally similar units into a flat design. The jiaomo technique, the tendency to geometricize the land masses, and the mountain landscapes with waterfalls and pine trees are school characteristics. Cheng remarked in his inscription that the ?high distance? (gaoyuan) mode, in which the composition is read vertically, was not favoured by artists of his time and region, who mostly employed the ?level distance? ( pingyuan) mode of Ni Zan and other masters of the river landscape (see China, ï¿½V, 3(iv)). The refinement of taste that Cheng developed through study of the family collection and deciphering old inscriptions imbues his calligraphy and seal-carving, as well as his painting, with an antiquarian flavour much admired by Chinese connoisseurs. They regard him as a forerunner of the Epigraphers? school (Jinshi jia) of practitioners of these three interlocked arts, a school that flourished in the late 18th century and the 19th.--DOA"@en .
