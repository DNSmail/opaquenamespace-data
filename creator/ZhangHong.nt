Ming dynasty (b Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, 1577; d ca. 1652). Chinese painter. Zhang was an educated man who attempted the official examinations but failed as a scholar and painted to support himself and his large family. He was a prolific and versatile painter who is best known for landscapes but also did figure compositions and animals, especially water buffalo. Many of his landscape paintings are topographical in character, depicting actual places; for instance, he travelled in eastern Zhejiang Province during spring 1639 and on his return painted an album of views of the region. In contrast to other Suzhou artists, Zhang did not use established compositional conventions and type-forms or the manner of some earlier master; instead he portrayed the scenes more as they appeared, adapting his representational means flexibly to the appearance of the scenery. This approach was not typical of his time, and his images were labelled strange and unusual. One of Zhang Hong?s earliest paintings, Landscape of Shixie Hill (1613; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.), depicts a hill in northern Zhejiang. He painted the scene for his elder brother, basing the image on a composition commonly used by painters of the Suzhou-based Wu school. Zhang departed from convention, however, in the way he depicted mountains and their vegetation together as a coherent unit, showing trees receding convincingly in space and rendering bamboo groves in a naturalistic manner. It was more common for Chinese painters of the time to depict vegetation and rocks as separate entities appearing to rest upon, rather than grow or jut from, the earth masses. Two works of the 1620s show a different character: Night Ascent of Huazi Hill (handscroll, 1625; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.) and an album, Zhi Garden (1627; dispersed). Night Ascent shows the 8th- century poet Wang Wei walking in the mountains on a winter night near his villa south of the capital Chang?an (now Xi?an, Shaanxi Province). The image is unique in Chinese painting: it shows a long ridge, beginning in the foreground, which winds gently upward to a vantage point upon which Wang Wei and two servants stand admiring the moon. The ease with which the viewer can follow the path to the top, the foreshortening of the hill, the seemingly natural way in which trees obscure houses and the evocative depiction of mist that blurs distinctions between one form and another combine to create a painterly effect quite different from the additive, analytical method of typical Chinese landscape painting. The Zhi Garden album, consisting of 20 leaves, is a systematic visual exploration of a garden in Suzhou. The first leaf, Whole View of the Zhi Garden (ink and colours on paper; Muzzano, priv. col., see Cahill, Distant Mountains, pl. 4), presents an elevated view of the whole site, complete with waterways, pavilions and garden walls. Subsequent leaves show scenes of the approach and interior of the garden, such that the viewer seems to move progressively through the setting. Garden paintings were a speciality of some Suzhou masters; bird?s-eye views and albums of selected garden scenes were also common (see also Garden, ï¿½VI, 1). Zhang Hong?s approach was unprecedented in that he successfully combined an analytical view of the component parts of the garden in the individual leaves with a synthesis of all the parts in Whole View. In the first leaf he suggests a consistent ground plane, a reasonably consistent angle of view and houses and trees that become smaller and less distinct as they near a gently curving horizon. The source for this apparently radical conception probably lies in European townscape prints, such as Georg Braun and Franz Hogenberg?s Civitatis urbis terrarum (1572?1617), a six-volume atlas of views and plans, which were introduced into Suzhou and Nanjing in the late Ming period by the Jesuits. Wind in the Pines at Mt Gouqu (1650; Boston, MA, Mus. F.A., see fig.) is a fine example of Zhang Hong?s later work. His departure from traditional Chinese landscape conventions is even more pronounced here than in Landscape of Shixie Hill, which still relied to some extent on a restructuring of the terrain. Distant land forms that would have been impossible to see from a single viewpoint were brought into the composition by placing them above the nearer hills. In Mt Gouqu Zhang relied less on such reorganization and produced an image that is consistent with the actual experience of viewing a landscape; he also used light washes of green and red?brown in addition to ink to approximate the soft hues, highlights and shaded hollows of verdant hills. Such techniques were discernible in the works of the 13th-century painter Xia Gui and early Ming period (1368?1644) artist Tang Yin, but, in contrast, Zhang reworked their methods in this painting in an emphatically naturalistic way. Despite Zhang?s innovations, Chinese critics seldom rated him above the miaopin (third, ?marvellous class?) or neng pin (lowest, ?capable class?) of painter as defined in the 9th century. This was because Zhang possessed few of the commendable traits, such as disciplined brushwork, adherence to Yuan period (1279?1368) models or standard compositional structures admired by the orthodox literati of the time. Much of his work was dismissed by his contemporaries as vulgar and popularist, but modern critics admire his innovative and naturalistic manner. --DOA"@en .
