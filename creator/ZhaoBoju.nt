Song dynasty (b Zhuo xian, Hebei Province, before 1123; d 1160?73). Chinese painter. His paintings of landscapes, figures, flowers, fruit and birds apparently ranged in size and format from large screens to handscrolls, album leaves and fans. The critic Zhao Xigu ( fl 1180?1240) considered Zhao Boju the best of all Southern Song (1127?1279) painters. However, no authentic work by Zhao Boju survives, leaving the question of his style open to interpretation. Zhao Boju and his younger brother, Zhao Bosu, also a painter, were 7th-generation descendants of the founder of the Song dynasty (960?1279), Emperor Taizu (reg 960?75). When Emperor Gaozong (reg 1127?62) was presented with a fan painting done by Zhao Boju, he was enormously pleased. On meeting Zhao in person and discovering him to be a kinsman, he addressed him as ?royal cousin? and assigned him the title of Military Commander of the eastern Zhejiang circuit, an office the short-lived Zhao held until his death. The Emperor commissioned Zhao to paint the screens for the hall called the Jiying dian and is known often to have inscribed Zhao?s works. The Zhao brothers reportedly believed that ?each artist ought to have his own sense of style within his breast, so that his spirit emerges spontaneously, and the work will exude a taste that is pure, refined and remote, unbounded by the formal conditions of the objects.? This is in keeping with the literati belittlement of physical verisimilitude and stress on the supremacy of expression, according to which a painter should attempt to capture the inner essence of the subject more than its outer form. Zhuang Su ( fl 12th?13th century) described Zhao Boju?s handscroll On the Yangzi River in the Sixth Lunar Month, bearing the imperial autograph, as imbued with the ?flavour and air of Dong Yuan and Wang Sheng [1072?after 1149]?. This indicates landscape painting with a Southern school affiliation, rather than in the Academy style. Zhao?s landscapes may have been of gentle earthen mounds with soft, rounded contours, in a continuation of the Jiangnan (south China) style promoted in the early 12th century by the great critic and spokesman for the literati, Mi Fu. Although the Zhao brothers were not members of the Imperial Painting Academy, they were pre- eminent in Southern Song painting circles, excelling in coloured (qinglï¿½) landscapes (usually associated with the Northern school) and figure painting. In the Yuan period (1279?1368) Xia Wenyan included bamboo and rocks in Zhao Boju?s area of expertise and said that by gazing at Zhao?s figure painting aspects of the sitters? personalities could be appreciated. However, these claims may typify a common tendency to exaggerate Zhao?s abilities that became pronounced following the master?s death, in response to the great demand for, and lack of, his works. Indeed, it seems that by the Yuan many attributions to Zhao were already spurious. Despite the scarcity of his works, many poems and encomia were written by critics on works ascribed to him. The composition most modern scholars associate with Zhao Boju is that of the stunning anonymous handscroll Jiangshan qiuse tujuan (?Handscroll of mountain and river autumn colours?; colours on silk; Beijing, Pal. Mus.). This title first appears in the 18th-century imperial catalogue Shiqu baoji, where the attribution to Zhao follows that made by Zhu Biao (1355?92) in 1375, based simply on its being a coloured landscape. In fact, the structure and perspective of the work link it to paintings such as a Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains (Beijing, Pal. Mus.) by Wang Ximeng (1096?1119), produced under Emperor Huizong (reg 1101?25). Jiangshan qiuse tujuan may offer a glimpse of what Zhao saw, but perhaps not of what he painted. --DOA"@en .
