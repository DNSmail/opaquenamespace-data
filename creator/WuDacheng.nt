Qing dynasty (b Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, 6 June 1835; d 6 March 1902). Chinese calligrapher, epigrapher and collector. Born into a rich and cultured merchant family, he entered the district school at 16 and at 17 began to study seal script (zhuanshu) under Chen Huan (1786?1863). He received his jinshi degree in 1868 and became a scholar at the Hanlin Academy in Beijing, followed by two years at the Suzhou Provincial Printing Office. In succeeding years, he distinguished himself as an army officer, diplomat and civil servant. He became Governor of Guangdong Province in 1887 and of Hunan in 1892, interrupted by a period as director-general of the conservancy of the Yellow River and the Grand Canal and followed by his directorship of the Longmen Academy in Shanghai in 1898. Wu amassed a large collection of antiquities. He became renowned as an interpreter of written characters used before the Qin period (221?206 bc) and completed a dictionary of seal characters, the Shuowen guzhou bu in 1883, in which calligraphy is categorized according to its provenance, e.g. from bronze and jade seal texts or from weights. By comparing these characters to those in the earliest Chinese dictionary, the Shuowen jiezi (?Dictionary of words and phrases?; c. ad 120), compiled by Xu Shen, Wu demonstrated that the characters in the Shuowen jiezi, accepted for centuries, were in fact based on more recent materials and not completely reliable. Wu compiled a catalogue of his entire collection, a book transcribing and deciphering the texts on his bronzes and a catalogue of his own and important bronzes in other collections in 1886. These were followed by catalogues of his seals, jades and weights and measures. In his catalogue on seals, he imitated the Song-period (960?1279) tradition of including the imprint of each seal in his presentation, which later became normal practice. In seal script, Wu began by studying the standard works of Li Yangbing ( fl c. ad 759?80), but soon moved on to Jiang Sheng (?1721?99). In his 20s, Wu became familiar with older seal script models: he discovered bronze and stele rubbings and began to study the Shuowen jiezi. Later influences came from specific bronzes in his collection or from other rubbings, such as one from the Maogong ding, sent to Wu by his friend Chen Jieqi (1813?84), a great collector, archaeologist and calligrapher. The Maogong ding is a bronze vessel on the bottom of which is inscribed in large seal script (da zhuanshu) the longest Zhou-period (c. 1050?256 bc) text known. A pair of matched hanging scrolls (duilian; see Shimonaka, no. 83) reveal Wu?s approach. The words are precisely spaced, the strokes stern, taut and full of power. The juxtaposition of these words in seal script, much closer to ancient pictographs than the later versions of the script, is naturally graphic. Wu adds to the complexity of the pattern through his modulation of each stroke, contrasting carefully rounded movements to the jagged, cut-off edge where the brush is more quickly lifted. --DOA"@en .
