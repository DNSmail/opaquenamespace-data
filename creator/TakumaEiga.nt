His precise relation to earlier members of the Takuma school is unclear, but he may have come from the lineage of Takuma Ry?ga. Eiga worked in a wide variety of styles ranging from minutely rendered and brightly coloured paintings reminiscent of orthodox Heian- period painting to ink monochrome works rendered in vigorous brushstrokes, which paralleled pictures by early Muromachi-period priest?painters of the Zen sect. Eiga?s diversity reflects the transitional nature of his age, when Japanese artists were absorbing Chinese styles developed during the Song and Yuan (1279?1368) periods. Among Eiga?s ?traditional? Buddhist paintings in colours are the triptychs of the Immovable One and Attendants (Jap. Fud? my?? ni d?ji; Skt Acalanatha; Tokyo, Seikad? Bunko) and of the Historical Buddha and Attendants (Jap. Shaka, Monju and Fugen; Skt Shakyamuni, Manjushri and Samantabhadra; Kyoto, Ch?my?ji). His set of Sixteen Arhats (Jap. J?roku rakan; Osaka, Fujita Mus. A.) represents a synthesis of that style with the ink monochrome sensibility adapted from Chinese painting. His ink monochrome painting of Fugen (Washington, DC, Freer) demonstrates an even greater adaptation of the most up-to-date developments in Buddhist painting. His one extant secular painting is an imaginary portrait of the great Nara-period (ad 710?94) poet Kakinomoto no Hitomaro (Kamakura, Tokiwayama Cult. Mus.). The date of the inscription by the priest Sh?kai Reiken, 1395, if interpreted as the year in which the painting was executed, would indicate that Eiga was active in the late 14th century; however, most art historians believe that he lived earlier in the century. -Grove Art Online"@en .
