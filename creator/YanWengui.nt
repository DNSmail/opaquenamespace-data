Song dynasty (b Wuxing [now in Zhejiang Province]; fl late 970s?early 11th century). Chinese painter. He probably studied with Hao Hui ( fl 10th?11th century) of Hedong (now in eastern Shanxi Province). He served in the military until the accession of the second emperor of the Song dynasty (960?1279), Taizong (reg 976?97), when he set forth by boat to the capital and sold figures and landscapes on the road leading to the Celestial Gate (Tian men). He is said to have been a court official, as a result of which he was accorded the honorary title of jiangshi lang (?court gentleman for ceremonial service?), and to have served as the zhubo (recorder or archivist) in Yunying District, Yunzhou. He rose to fame, according to one account (the Shengchao minghua ping; ?Critique of famous painters of the present dynasty?, by the Song writer Liu Daochun), during the reign of Emperor Taizong when Gao Yi, a painter in attendance (daizhao) at the Hanlin Painting Academy, bought several of Yan?s paintings and presented them to the Emperor, saying: ?As your servant is charged with the restoration of [flood-damaged] murals in the temple Xiangguo si, may it be submitted that for the painting of the rocks and trees in the project, only Wengui can be sure to paint them successfully.? Taizong was so impressed by the paintings and the recommendation that he appointed Yan to an unspecified position in the Academy. Another Northern Song art historian, Guo Ruoxu, wrote in the Tuhua jianwen zhi (?Experiences in painting?; preface 1075) that during the reign of Emperor Zhenzong (reg 998?1023), Yan was a member of a team of 30,000 men who were building and painting the Daoist temple complex Yuqing zhaoying gong and that during his leisure hours he painted some landscapes. These so impressed the superintendent that Yan was recommended to the Hanlin Painting Academy for the position of usher (zhihou). Both accounts are uncorroborated. In landscapes Yan Wengui did not follow the ancients but created a new style of his own, in which he represented the myriad aspects of nature with startling lifelike vividness. These landscapes came to be known as Yan jia jingzhi (?Yan school scenes?). Yan also excelled in depicting houses, palaces, boats and carts, usually by means of ruled lines. A characteristic peculiar to his work was the incorporation of minutely rendered architectural details within free-hand landscape passages. Liu Daochun also reported that Yan?s fan paintings pleased the Emperor and that he once painted the Qixi [Summer] Night Market, showing its bustling activities with astonishing fidelity. Yan?s album Puochuan duhai xiang (?Pictures of boats coming back from sea?), owned by a wealthy merchant, was only about 300 mm high and depicted boats the size of small leaves and people the size of wheat grains; masts, sails, steering oars and people pointing and shouting were all rendered with amazing precision, and there were marvellous images of mighty waves, distant islands and sea monsters surging across the oceans. According to Guo Ruoxu, people kept in their homes screen paintings and hanging scrolls by Yan; and Deng Chun recorded in his Hua ji (?Painting continued?; see China, ï¿½V, 5) that he owned a set of Yan?s four seasons paintings (all untraced), including such evocative titles as Waxing Moon over the Flowering Village, Evening Rain on the Calm River, Mists in the Bamboo Forest at Dusk and Remaining Snow at Pine Stream. The titles, format and sequential character serve to exemplify what were later known as Yan school scenes. The landscape painting Towers and Pavilions amid Rivers and Mountains ( Jiangshan louguan; handscroll, ink on paper; Osaka, Mun. Mus. A.) bears Yan?s name and is the work most consistently attributed to the artist by 20th-century art historians. In its handling of brush and ink and brush motifs, the style resembles that of his contemporary Fan kuan, by whom Yan was much influenced. Broad, swelling strokes of thick, black ink define both the contour lines of the boulder and the horizontal plane of the mountain. The rocky surface is modelled with finer, relatively centred, short ink strokes, with slashes of horizontal accents in the area of sheer rock-faces. The work has been dated to the mid-11th century largely on the grounds of the variety of modelling strokes used; in later works attributed to the master these became more unified and stylized. The mountains are girdled in mist and the bottom is highlighted, emphasizing the vertiginous feeling and the spatial expanse between the ranges. Houses and manmade objects are unnaturally small, dwarfed by the grandeur of nature, in which men and beasts, though depicted naturalistically, serve as incidental accents. Towers and Pavilions accords in structure and appearance with descriptions of Yan?s style by Yuan-period (1279?1368) observers. In the same period Ni Zan and Qian Weishan wrote of a painting associated with Yan called Lonely Temple in Autumn Mountains (Qiushan xiaosi; untraced). It depicted vertiginous precipices, riders hurrying lightly on stone-paved paths, wintry winds sending off distant skiffs, in short, a hoary, autumnal panorama described in minute detail and full of antique feeling. Another hanging scroll, called Towers and Pavilions amid Streams and Mountains (Qishan louguan) (Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.; see fig.), shows similar composition and motifs. There is an emphatic use of the small, vertical texture brushstrokes associated with Fan Kuan?s modelling of rocky mountain surfaces, later called yudian cun (?raindrop texture strokes?). The many granite peaks rise ever higher as they recede. Overall, the painting recalls the Osaka handscroll, but the somewhat mannerized application of contour outlines and texture strokes may reveal a later interpretation of the style. Its present dimensions (1039ï¿½474 mm) and incomplete appearance suggest that it may have been part of a larger, wider composition, perhaps one of a series of six or eight panels of a screen. --DOA"@en .
