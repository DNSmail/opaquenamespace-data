Chinese painter. He was one of the principal founders of the Lingnan school of painting in southern China in the 1920s and 1930s. He sought to modernize the Chinese art world by introducing new painting techniques and through such innovations as public art exhibitions and art classes in public institutions. The three founders of the Lingnan school?Gao Jianfu, his younger brother Gao Qifeng (1889?1935), and Chen Shuren (1883?1949)?all served their apprenticeships in traditional Chinese painting at the studio of Ju Lian (1828?1904) in Lishan in Panyu County. Between 1892 and 1898 Gao studied and executed paintings of birds, flowers and insects in Ju Lian?s style and, under the patronage of a wealthy collector, Wu Deyi (d c. 1920), made numerous copies of paintings of the Song (960? 1279) and Yuan (1279?1368) periods in Wu?s collection. In 1903 Gao enrolled at the Guangzhou (Canton) Christian College, where he studied Western painting under Mai La (a Frenchman). Two years later he became a teacher at an elementary school. These were formative years, not only artistically but also in Gao?s exposure to the turbulent political and intellectual currents of the time, which made him increasingly open to revolutionary ideology. To continue his artistic studies, Gao travelled to Tokyo in 1905, followed by Gao Qifeng and Chen Shuren, and soon became a member of the Alliance Society (Tongmeng hui), a precursor of the Chinese Nationalist Party (Guomindang or KMT). In his bid to forge a new visual language, Gao turned to subjects found in Japanese painting, particularly lions, tigers, hawks and eagles set in picturesque landscapes, which were fused with a naturalism and vigour quite new to contemporary Chinese painting. He also introduced a romantic element by his frequent use of mists and snow and by underscoring allegorical messages. When Gao returned to Guangzhou in 1908 he helped establish a branch of the Alliance Society under cover of a painting shop. He worked for the Alliance until the end of the 1911 uprising that marked the end of the Qing dynasty (1644?1911), and the establishment of the Republic (1912?49). In 1912 he withdrew from politics and moved to Shanghai with his brother. There he opened his own publishing house, the most significant product of which was The True Record (Zhenxiang huabao), a magazine containing photographs as well as drawings and text closely linked to politics. He also pioneered the public art exhibition, showing (and selling) his work in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Guangzhou and Hong Kong. In 1916 the Gao brothers moved back to Guangzhou and Jianfu became a member of the Guangdong Industrial Art Commission, head of the Provincial Industrial School and founder of the Spring Slumber Studio (Chunshui huayuan), where his students and associate artists became known as the Lingnan Painters. Characteristic of the New Chinese-style Painting (Xin guohua) they created was the fusion of Japanese and Western artistic values, such as perspective, atmosphere and chiaroscuro, with traditional Chinese brushwork. Steed Hualiu in Wind and Rain (1925), the Five- storey Pavilion (1926) and Evening Bell at the Misty Temple (undated) are typical paintings of the new movement. In 1931 Gao travelled to Burma, India, Ceylon, Persia and Egypt. On his return to China, he wrote several books on his experiences and took up a post at the National Sun Yat-sen university, Guangzhou. In 1935 he became visiting professor at the Central University in Nanjing, which became an important platform for his views. In one lecture he delivered there, published in 1955 as ?My Views on Modern Chinese Painting?, he stressed the need to combine Western artistic ideas with Chinese traditions and to include modern subject-matter in Chinese painting. During the 1920s and 1930s Gao painted landscapes in which aeroplanes, automobiles, railways and the ravages of war were clearly depicted. With the outbreak of war against Japan in 1937 the Lingnan school quickly fell from favour, and although exhibitions continued to be held in Macao, where Gao fled after the Communist takeover of China in 1949, it lost its momentum.--DOA"@en .
