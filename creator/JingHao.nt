Five dynasties (b either Qinshui [nr modern Jiyuan] or nr Henei, both Henan Province, c. ad 855?80; d c. 915? 40). Chinese painter. Jing was the foremost of the great monumental monochrome landscape painters of the Five Dynasties period (906?60) in northern China. According to critics he was already recognized as a master among landscape painters at the end of the Tang period (618?907). In Mi Fu?s Hua shi (?History of painting?; preface 1103) it is recorded that Jing taught Guan Tong and that later his work was studied by Li Cheng and Fan Kuan. Jing was a Confucian scholar, well versed in the Chinese classics. He may have been a minor official under Zhaozong (reg 888?904) at Bianliang (modern Kaifeng), Henan Province, or Chang?an (modern Xi?an), Shaanxi Province. However, from about the age of 35, he led a solitary life at Honggu in the Taihang Mountains, Henan, taking refuge from the fighting prior to the collapse of the Tang dynasty. He apparently supported himself there by farming but continued to paint, adopting the literary name (hao) of Hongguzi. While he appears never to have relinquished the influence of his Confucian background, his interpretations of landscape also reflect a Daoist love of nature. The subject-matter of Jing?s paintings was somewhat limited in range. In his mid-20s, while still a city-dweller, he executed a wall painting of the bodhisattva Guanyin (Skt Avalokiteshvara) on Mt Potalaka for the Shuanglin si, a temple in Bianliang. Later he was known mainly for landscapes, although apparently he also painted compositions of rocks and trees. His writings describe old gnarled pines, mossy cliffs and mysterious caves as ?familiar companions?. His reflections on natural forms exhibit not only a close observation of nature, but also a reconciliation of Daoist and Confucian principles: ?Every tree grows according to its natural disposition. The pine trees may grow tortuous, but they do not fall in with the deceitful; they are upright from the very beginning. ? They are like diverging thoughts which must be brought into harmony? (Sirï¿½n, 1956?8, p. 236). An early treatise on landscape painting, the Bifa ji (?Notes on brush method?, c. 925), is attributed to Jing Hao; it reflects the characteristic attitudes of the great landscape painters of the 10th century, setting forth certain general ideas about the study and scope of painting. It deals primarily with the concept of value in painting and the ultimate criterion of good painting as truth, not in terms of outward likeness but of inner reality or spirit, reflecting a background of Confucian morality. The ?painter of truth? was a sage-artist who could ?divine the emblems (hsiang) of objects and thus grasp their essence? (Wen Fong and Watt, 1996, p. 124). It also offers a modified scheme of the Six Laws established by Xie He (fl c. 500?35) four centuries earlier (see China, ï¿½V, 5(i)) and makes comments about, and evaluations of, masters of the Tang and earlier periods. The writing reflects a preference for Tang painters who introduced new techniques, such as Wang Wei. The coarse techniques of the 9th century are considered inferior to the 8th-century fashion of ?axe and chisel? texturing in linear, clear and rational patterns. Concern for diversity of stroke and ink tone is expressed in theories regarding the two aspects of ?brush? and ?ink?. These aspects were later treated by Guo Ruoxu and also in the Xuanhe huapu (?Xuanhe collection of painting?; c. 1120); the latter text explains them: ?To have brush but no ink [means that] the traces of the brush [as such] remain visible throughout, [resulting in] a want of naturalness. To have ink but no brush means that 'axe and chisel' strokes are discarded and replaced by too erratic formations? (Loehr, p. 89). The group of paintings attributed to Jing Hao are so inconsistent in execution that it is questionable whether they are in fact the work of one individual. However, all share certain general qualities, reflecting a preoccupation with the relationship between brush and ink. In defining form and texturing surfaces Jing?s brushwork is fluid, with variations both in ink tone and in width of brushstroke, as in cursive script (caoshu) calligraphy. He is credited with introducing innovations in the modelling and texturing of rock forms by use of texture strokes (cun). Another early technique visible in works associated with Jing is the use of a series of overlapping forms to build up rocks and mountains, though this is somewhat artificial. The compositions identified with Jing suggest a unity of vision not evident in earlier paintings, though they lack the convincing three-dimensional quality of later Chinese paintings. Travellers in Snow-covered Mountains (hanging scroll, Kansas City, MO, Nelson?Atkins Mus. A.), signed ?Hongguzi? in the lower right-hand corner, was reportedly recovered from a tomb in Shaanxi Province in the late 1930s. It is in poor condition, with some areas totally destroyed. Some minor retouching, done when it was being restored and remounted in Beijing, is not consistent with the original composition. Nevertheless, the painting is significant as a source of study on what is otherwise a virtually unknown period of Chinese painting. The monumental Kuanglu Mountains (see fig.), the best extant work attributed to Jing, is not signed but was identified with him as early as the Southern Song period (1127?1279), as indicated in a short inscription by Emperor Gaozong in the upper right-hand corner. While the painting itself is probably later, the composition may be Jing Hao?s, since the style is consistent with what is known of 10th-century landscape. It represents a range of rhythmically patterned, strongly vertical mountain forms gradually disappearing into distant haze. Visual entry into the landscape occurs at the lower left-hand corner; a road wends its way past a group of houses near the base of a waterfall and clustered mountains back to another complex of structures approximately halfway up the left-hand side of the composition. The mountain forms are balanced to the right by a level viewing area defining the rather sharp, pitched angle of the ground plane. There is a strong sense of isolation, since the few structures provide the only sense of human presence. While the painting represents a major development from earlier, more compartmentalized compositions, it lacks the sense of continuity of later 10th-century conceptions. --DOA"@en .
