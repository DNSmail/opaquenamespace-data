Chinese painter and writer. Luo was the youngest of the major Yangzhou school painters of the 18th century and a significant innovator in the genres of portraiture and depiction of ghosts. Born into a family of scholar?officials, in his early career Luo was much influenced by Jin Nong, his teacher in poetry and painting from about 1757. After Jin?s death in 1763 Luo undertook the editing of some of his mentor?s writings, together with other quasi-filial duties. Jin?s historical and self-conscious exploration of a broad range of genres, including plum and bamboo painting, portraiture and Buddhist figure painting, clearly influenced Luo?s choice of subject- matter. However, the relationship was not one-sided: Luo was more technically accomplished than his teacher and probably painted works to which Jin signed his own name. Luo?s portrait Jin Nong Taking a Noon Nap (hanging scroll; 1760; Shanghai Mus.) is notably informal and irreverent in style. Several other paintings from Luo?s early career document both his entrance, by the early 1760s, into the cultured circles of south-east China and his exploration of the significance of portraiture. A second portrait, Jin Nong, and an image of the antiquarian and seal-carver Ding Jing (hanging scrolls on paper; both Hangzhou, Zhejiang Prov. Mus.) depict the scholars as luohan (Skt: arhats) and reflect Luo?s religious interests as well as his flexible conception of the self. Related to these paintings is a portrait of the Chan Buddhist Master Tan (hanging scroll; 1763; Suzhou Mus.), the inscription on which suggests a composite identity for the sitter, part contemporary monk and part legendary Chan eccentric. Luo?s probing of the conceptual boundaries of portraiture recurs in a portrait of the eminent writer, Yuan Mei (1781; Muko, Shujiro Shimada priv. col.), where the problematic nature of the identity of the subject is noted by the sitter in his long and witty inscription. After Jin?s death, Luo travelled widely: in 1764 and 1765 he visited parts of Jiangsu, Anhui and Jiangxi provinces, and in 1771 and 1779 he went to Beijing, where he remained until the last months of his life. As earlier in Yangzhou, Luo associated with many leading scholar?officials and literary men of the capital. His greatest success, though a qualified one, was an eight- section scroll, the Guiqu tu (?The fascination of ghosts?; see fig.), painted before 1772. One of Luo?s several variations on the theme, this painting bears a number of appreciative and critical inscriptions. Luo?s ghost scenes reflect, and perhaps exploit, a broad contemporary taste for the literary genre of ghost stories. Nonetheless, the sincerity of his interest in ghosts and other occult phenomena is certain; his essay collection Woxin lu (?Record of my beliefs?; 1791) has chapters on reincarnation, ghosts and spirits, as well as on the significance of many of his paintings. Moreover, in comparison to the merely humorous grotesqueries of contemporary standard ghost paintings, Luo?s Guiqu tu is distinguished both by its subtly appropriate technical devices?murkily suffused ink washes, bleeding, indistinct contours and eerily unnatural colours? and by its glimpses of anguish, confusion and terror associated with the human world. Luo?s largest body of work comprised minor technical and compositional variations on the standard Yangzhou school themes of bamboo, plum and epidendrum. He also painted explicitly Buddhist themes, sometimes on temple walls. Two landscape albums from around the 1770s best display his technical mastery, together with a thematic subtlety and ingenuity to rival anything of his century: Landscapes (Princeton U., NJ, A. Mus.) and Landscapes Illustrating the Poems of Jiang Kui of the Southern Song (1774; Washington, DC, Freer). The latter includes such inventive scenes as a rabbit fleeing the vividly realized chaos of a forest fire. Despite his originality and early success, Luo spent his later years living quietly in Beijing temples or at the residences of patrons, and he died almost destitute, exemplifying the precarious position of the institutionally independent artist of the 18th century, subject to financial pressures and shifting tastes. --DOA"@en .
