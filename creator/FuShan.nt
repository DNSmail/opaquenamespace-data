Chinese calligrapher, painter, poet and scholar?official. He was born in northern China to a scholarly family. When he was only 15 he passed the local examination, the first of three stages in the civil service examination ladder, to receive his xiucai degree and in 1625 became a stipendiary. Following his failure in the next stage?the provincial examinations?he went to study at the San Li Academy in Taiyuan. There he gained a reputation as a man of high moral character, in part because of his aversion to widespread official corruption in the late part of the Ming period (1368?1644); this may have hindered his advancement to an official career. After the Manchu conquest and the subsequent establishment of the Qing dynasty (1644?1911), Fu Shan?s loyalty to the preceding dynasty led to his imprisonment and torture. In 1655, however, his students secured his release, and he began a period of travel in the northern provinces, visiting famous mountains, including Mt Hua in Shaanxi Province and Mt Tai in Shandong Province. During this period he worked as a physician and won renown as a poet. At the age of 72, Fu Shan was urged to take the boxue hongci examination, which Qing officials hoped would bring eminent scholars into the administration. He refused but was compelled nonetheless to journey to Beijing to pay his respects to the court. When he reached the city gates Fu Shan would go no further, throwing himself to the ground in protest. His action was interpreted as a gesture of obeisance, and he was allowed to return to Shanxi with the title of Secretary of the Grand Secretariat, an honour which he never acknowledged. He spent his later years in Songzhuang, south of Taiyuan, and died there. As a calligrapher, Fu Shan is regarded as one of the most original talents of his time; he favoured deliberately misshapen characters and once avowed that he preferred ?deformities to slipperiness, the spontaneous to the premeditated?. A similar inclination is seen in his paintings, which are mostly of pines and rocks, bamboo or landscapes. An undated landscape (see fig.) represents a river valley winding among cliffside houses and leafy trees. Thin, even brushstrokes define the form of the rock groupings and provide texture; the thickly wooded foreground landscape becomes increasingly light and barren as the valley yields to distant peaks, and zigzag movements create a sense of depth. In the centre of the painting an overhang merges confusingly with adjacent cliffs so that there is no clear sense of which rock face precedes another. Like Wu bin, Fu Shan also painted fanciful or fantastic landscapes. Some examples of this kind on album leaves depict flamelike peaks and pinnacles, meandering streams and waterfalls. These visionary landscapes are quite different from the plain riverscapes of the Southern school artists of the Jiangnan region and the more conservative works of the Northern school landscapists.--DOA"@en .
