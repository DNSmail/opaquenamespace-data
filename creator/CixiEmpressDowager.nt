Alternate names: Ci Xi, Yehe Nala Qing dynasty Daughter of a minor official, entered the palace as a concubine. Gave birth to a son and was raised to second concubine. After the Emperor Wenzong died, her son became heir. She and Wenzong's senior wife became regents. Cixi eventually took complete power after the deaths of her son and co-regent. Overspent treasury and was out of touch with political situation, after Boxer Rebellion attempted reforms, but died in 1908 unable to salvage the Imperial dynasty. Enjoyed calligraphy and painting--her large scale calligraphy was often given as gifts, as were her paintings. Of the latter, many were actually created by court artists and given in her name. --Weidner"@en .
