Qing dynasty Lingnan school: Term used to refer to a style and movement established by a small group of painters in Guangdong Province who studied in Japan in the early 20th century. Lingnan (Chin.: ?south of the mountains?) is often used less properly for all artists from Guangdong. The main figures of the school were Gao jianfu, his brother Gao Qifeng (1889?1935) and their compatriot Chen Shuren (1883?1949). All three came from Panyu County near Guangzhou [Canton] and learnt the foundations of traditional Chinese painting from the Guangdong master Ju Lian (1828? 1904), who specialized in bird-and-flower subjects. Ju Lian painted in the ?boneless? (mogu) style practised by the 17th-century master Yun Shouping. However, he also pioneered or perfected new colouring and ink-spreading techniques that were to influence Lingnan school artists, among them ?splashed water? (zhuang shui) and ?sprinkled powder? (zhuang fen). In the latter, white powder was sprinkled on to the coloured areas, especially flower petals, to produce a bright, somewhat glossy surface. In the former, the ?boneless? technique for painting leaves was extended by carefully controlling the flow of dripped water to form the borders. All of Ju Lian?s followers, most notably Chen Shuren, mastered the style of combining such techniques with meticulous attention to naturalistic detail, which imparted a freshness to studies of small birds and insects. This type of painting (e.g. Hong Kong, Chin. U., A.G.) is usually in album leaf or fan painting format; large hanging scrolls were painted only occasionally, as in an impressive undated work by Ju Lian, Rocks, Insects and Flowers (Guangzhou, Guangdong Prov. Mus.). --DOA"@en .
