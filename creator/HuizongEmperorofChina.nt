Song dynasty (b Tianshui, Gansu Province, 1082; reg 1101?26; d Wuguocheng, Yilan, Heilongjiang Province, 1135). Chinese ruler and painter. The last emperor of the Northern Song period (960?1127), he was the 11th son of the emperor Shenzong (reg 1068?85). Huizong is considered to be the only accomplished artist in a line of emperors who all shared an interest in the arts. The fall of the Northern Song dynasty is usually attributed to Huizong?s neglect of his official duties in favour of religious and cultural pursuits. This preoccupation is described in miscellaneous notes of Deng Chun (fl 1127?67) in the Hua ji (?Painting continued?; 1167) and by Tang Hou (fl 1322) in the Gujin huajian (?Mirror of past and present painting?; 1320s), as well as in later chronicles such as the Tuhui baojian (?Precious mirror for examining painting?; preface dated 1365) by Xia Wenyan. The development of Huizong?s aesthetic preferences and of his painting and calligraphy was supervised by three friends. They were all of high social rank but had different interests, and their preferences are reflected in the eclectic nature of the emperor?s style. Zhao Lingrang (fl c. 1070?1100) was a painter and connoisseur who assisted the emperor in his search for scrolls to add to the imperial collection. Wu Yuanyu (fl c. 1080?1104) has been described as a conservative academician. He was a pupil of Cui Bo (fl mid-11th century) and a conduit of the realistic tradition of painting to the emperor. The painter, connoisseur and collector Wang Shen (c. 1046? c. 1110) was also an eclectic intellectual calligrapher; he introduced the emperor to the calligraphic style of Huang Tingjian (1045?1105). While the emperor is best known for his bird- and-flower paintings, his calligraphy is probably the most significant of his accomplishments. It is highly personal and very different from the meticulous paintings attributed to him. Its unique style is described in a single reference by Tao Zongyi (fl 1350) in his Shushi hui yao (?Essentials of calligraphy?): ?The brush in Huizong?s running-cursive (xingshu) and regular (kaishu) scripts is graceful and powerful. He first studied the calligraphy of Xueji (648?718), and then altered [his master?s] brush method and manner to produce a style which he himself called 'slender gold' script [shoujin ti]. The brushwork and style [of his calligraphy] evolved naturally and independently [of his master?s], so that [the relationship with Xueji] cannot easily be sought.? (Chuang, p. 1.) As a collector Huizong invoked his rank to appropriate desirable paintings from sometimes unwilling owners. They are catalogued in the Xuanhe huapu (?Xuanhe collection of painting?; compiled before 1119) with a preface written by the emperor and form the nucleus of the Palace Museum collection in Taipei. Huizong?s artistic significance is due in great part to the influence he exerted on others. During his reign the Hanlin Painting Academy became a centre of art education as well as painting (see also China, ï¿½V, 4(i)(c)). Members were officially graded in various ranks and were required in periodic examinations to illustrate quotations chosen by the emperor. The winning work was usually selected more on the basis of the originality of idea than on artistic merit. Huizong also maintained close supervision of paintings executed in the Baolu gong (Palace of Daoist Scriptures), where he required a flawless technique that tended to stultify painting as it emphasized craftsmanship over expression of feeling. It is difficult to assess Huizong?s true talent in painting. Early Chinese historians were anxious to elevate him to a status almost of martyrdom, and their laudatory adjectives made later objective evaluations difficult. For example, Deng Chun identifies the emperor as a genius and Tang Hou classifies his paintings as either ?wonderful? or ?divine?. Another problem of evaluation arises from the tradition, according to early accounts, that when the emperor painted a picture, it was immediately copied by courtiers and artists seeking to obtain his signature on their work. This would explain the discrepancies in style of the paintings with authenticated signatures generally attributed to Huizong. According to Song- and Yuan-period (1279?1368) critics, Huizong painted successfully both in colour and monochrome ink, and several extant works in these traditions are available for comparison. The monochrome ink paintings are described as following the traditions of Li Cheng and Guo Xi. Landscapes and bamboo paintings put him in competition with the contemporary literati. Re-creations of early works can be studied in his copies of past masters such as Zhang Xuan. Ladies Preparing Newly Woven Silk (colour on silk, 370ï¿½1450 mm; Boston, MA, Mus. F.A.) is a copy attributed to Huizong by his grandson, the Jin emperor, Zhangzong (reg 1190?1209), who utilizes his ancestor?s calligraphic style in his inscription. Huizong is best known, however, for bird-and-flower album leaves composed in a pre- Song tradition. Carefully delineated forms drawn from life (xiesheng) in the tradition of Cui Bo rely on colour alone in the ?boneless? (mogu) technique of the Southern Tang (ad 937?75) artist Xu Xi. They create a new synthesis using the compositional device of flattened space characteristic of Huang Quan of the Five Dynasties period (907?60). This synthesis is exemplified by the Five-coloured Parakeet (horizontal scroll, colour on silk, 530ï¿½1250 mm; Boston, MA, Mus. F.A.), which bears his signature but which is probably not his work. The Dove on the Branch of a Blossoming Peach Tree (Tokyo, Sets? Gatodo priv. col.) is similar in composition and of more acceptable authenticity. Its technical perfection makes any individuality difficult to detect, but it exemplifies the flawless technique associated with the emperor. --DOA"@en .
