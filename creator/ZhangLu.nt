<http://opaquenamespace.org/ns/creator/ZhangLu> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Holden, Wendy; 'A Guide to Cataloguing Chinese Art', Visual Resources Association Special Bulletin No. 13, (1050138x). z36l45 Alternate names: Chang Lu, ?? Ming dynasty (b Bianliang (now Kaifeng), Henan Province, 1464; d 1538). Chinese painter. A member of a wealthy family, he was acquainted with the works of Dai Jin and Wu Wei and, despite his northern origins, is recognized as a follower of the Zhe school. His paintings were highly appreciated in his own time, especially in the north, according to Wang Shizhen, who described him as a follower of Wu Wei excelling in ?firmness and muscular strength? but lacking some of Wu?s ?refinement and freedom?. A biography by Zhang?s friend Zhu Ankan included some of Zhang?s own comments on painting. He believed there were few true connoisseurs of art, past or present, because so few people knew how to paint, and it was not possible for such people, even those of the greatest natural genius, to understand anything about painting. Even less likely was it that people who did not know how to paint could appreciate or even apprehend the strength or weakness of brushwork or the clearness or muddiness of ink-wash tonalities. According to Zhu, Zhang painted from nature, contemplating and searching for a true understanding before beginning to paint, then using his brush ?as Heaven created all things, without stopping from beginning to end? (Barnhart, pp. 372?3). By the end of the Ming period (1368?1644), however, other critics vilified Zhang?s work; He Liangjun (1506?73), for example, wrote of Jiang Song and Wang Zhi of Nanjing and Zhang Lu of the north that he would be ashamed to wipe his table with their paintings. A number of paintings by Zhang exist in collections in China and elsewhere; other works not yet identified may prove to be his. Generally large and executed in ink and ink wash on silk, they show a sure use of colour as well. Two Women Looking at Paintings (Princeton U., NJ, A. Mus.), unsigned but here attributed to Zhang, shows a mastery of figure painting on a large scale in a landscape setting. The magnificent Eagle Stooping on a Hare in Winter, signed Pingshan (Nanjing, Jiangsu Prov. Mus.), shows Zhang?s skill in transforming a Song-period (960?1279) subject into his favourite ink-wash idiom. --DOA"@en .
