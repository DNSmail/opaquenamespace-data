Five dynasties (b Zhongling [modern Jin xian], Jiangxi Province, or Jiangning [modern Nanjing], Jiangsu Province; fl ad 975?93). Chinese painter. Juran and his predecessor Dong yuan practised what was known in the Northern Song period (960?1127) as scholar painting (shidaifu hua) and are widely regarded as founders of the so-called Southern school of scholar?amateur idealist painting. Juran was initially a Buddhist monk in Jiangning, the Southern Tang (ad 937?75) capital. After Tang capitulation to the Northern Song in 975, he moved to the Song capital of Bianliang (Kaifeng) where, living in the Kaiyuan Temple, he produced landscape scrolls and murals and achieved fame as a painter. Between 985 and 993, Su Yijian, scholar at the Hanlin Academy, built two studio-pavilions east and west of the Jade Hall, part of the Hanlin Academy, and commanded Juran to paint their exterior walls. Juran produced Yanlan xiaojing (?Smokey mountain vapours at dawn?), which became celebrated. Hong Zunyi wrote in his Hanyuan qunshu that Juran?s ?brush traces [were] wild and untrammelled like Li Cheng, yet he achieved the marvels of his own distinct style?. Before 1059 Liu Daoshun ( fl mid-11th century) ranked Juran in the third class of painters of landscapes and woods, as one ?excellent at capturing the essential flavour of scenes?. In 1075 Guo Ruoxu ( fl 11th century) wrote, ?woods and trees are not his forte?, although otherwise his ?brush and ink are elegant and moist; he excels in misty, vaporous effects [in painting], tall and expansive desolate vistas of mountains and streams?. Shen Gua (1030?94) wrote, ?Monk Juran followed the methods of Dong Yuan, attaining the utmost in marvellous principles. Both their works are best viewed from afar. Their brushwork is rather cursory, not resembling anything at close range. But from a distance objects and scenes emerge brilliantly, inspiring profound feelings and distant thoughts, as if one were contemplating unknown lands?. Mi Fu (see Mi, (2)), writing c. 1100, gives the most detail about Juran?s paintings and his techniques. He observed that ?Juran followed Dong Yuan. There are many paintings extant with pure and moist vapours achieving a natural and naive quality in their construction. In his youth Juran used too many alum-heads [on the mountain slopes, but] in old age he attained a lofty flavour in unassertiveness?. On a Juran painting entitled The Ocean Wilderness (untraced), Mi wrote, partly in verse, ?At the river?s edge by the ocean wilderness the vistas are broad, woods are far, mists dispersed, pale to the ends of the skies; evening tides rise up by the wooded hamlet, stars in array, the night skies over the fishing village are alive?, giving an impression of thematic content and imagery. Mi also noted the similarity between Juran?s works and those of Liu Daoren (?Daoist Liu?), also a follower of Dong Yuan. The Xuanhe huapu (?Xuanhe collection of painting?; compiled before 1119), a catalogue of Emperor Huizong?s collection, lists 136 works ascribed to Juran, indicating the high regard in which he was held. These include six sets of six panels, four sets of four panels, eight triptychs and twelve double panels. Panels were hung side by side or mounted as screens to create a broad, and in the case of six-panel series, horizontal panorama. The Xuanhe huapu also describes many of the motifs used in Juran?s works: Besides pinnacled ranges, mountain caverns, between wooded glens in his landscapes, he painted pebbles, pines and cedars, bamboo, rushes and grasses in mutual correspondence. With lonely streams and narrow paths, bamboo fences and thatched huts, broken bridges and precarious plank roads, his paintings exude the flavour of real mountain scenery. Some people say that his substantive style is soft and weak. This is not so. The ancients used to say, ?[A painting that has] secluded places in which one can live, level areas where one can roam, nature-made places that amaze one, sheer drops and precipitous cliffs that frighten one, is truly a good painting.? While Juran?s work is fine and fragmented, its spirit is rather like this ? his painting of water, with crashing waves and billowing foam, causes people?s hair to stand on end, with the smoke and clouds transforming right before our eyes. The importance of Juran in Chinese painting since the early 12th century cannot be overestimated. Mi Fu extolled Juran and Dong Yuan?s unassertive style of misty southern hills and condemned the work of almost every other artist. In particular, he criticized the vigorous representation of hoary northern mountains with angular, granite crags as vulgar and extravagantly attention- seeking. Mi also initiated, with mixed emotions, a reverence for Li cheng, who used ink sparingly, ?as if it were gold?. Early writers? references to Li Cheng?s sparing use of ink and Juran?s adoption of Li Cheng?s style, and to reconstructions of Mi Fu?s own works, suggest that Mi promoted a rather amorphous style of painting, relying on dextrous use of graded ink wash, sometimes extremely pale, deployed over large areas of the painting surface. Subsequent scholar? gentry criticism tended to follow suit and extol the southern Dong?Ju and Li?Guo (Li Cheng and Guo Xi) styles. In the Yuan period (1279?1368) scholar?amateur painters, notably the Four Masters of the Yuan?Huang Gongwang, Ni Zan, Wu Zhen and Wang Meng?followed the Dong?Ju style as perceived through attributed works. An important feature was the ?hemp-fibre stroke? ( pima cun) used for texture modelling, moistened with graded ink wash to accentuate light and dark. By the 14th century, a limited vocabulary of tree groupings and mountain forms had become established as the Dong?Ju mode. Many unsigned attributions to Juran in the National Palace Museum, Taipei, feature the ?hemp- fibre stroke?, as finalized in the Yuan, notably Xiao Yi zhuan ?Lanting xu? (?Xiao Yi steals [Wang Xizhi?s] 'Orchid Pavilion Preface'?), a Yuan copy of a late Northern Song composition; Nangqin huaihe (?Cherished companions: crane and lute?), a 14th-century accretion; Qiushan tu (?Autumn mountains?), a 15th-century close copy of a Yuan composition; and Qiushan wendao (?Asking the way in autumn mountains?), a 15th-century accretion. Two earlier attributions from the late 11th to early 12th centuries are Cengyan congshu (?Layered peaks and clumps of woods?; untraced) and Qishan lanruo (?Buddhist retreat by stream and mountain?; see fig.), the latter a title given in the Xuanhe huapu as a six-panel panorama. These works feature a less clearly defined ?hemp-fibre stroke? and less schematized mountain contours and echo woods and trees, reminiscent of those mentioned by early writers in connection with Juran, and alum-heads as described by Mi Fu. Using moist, pale ink wash in lieu of linear ?hemp-fibre stroke? modelling, they represent an earlier stage in the evolution of the Juran tradition. The dramatic contrast in light and shade and disappearance into mist are typical of early Northern Song rendering. --DOA"@en .
