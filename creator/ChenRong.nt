Song dynasty (b Changle, Fujian Province; fl 1235?62). Chinese painter and poet. He passed the national civil-service examination to obtain the title of jinshi in 1235 and held several official posts, the last of which was the governorship of Putian (Fujian Province). He specialized in monochrome-ink paintings of dragons, and he was also well known as the author of heroic poems during the 1250s. He is said to have studied the poems and paintings of flying dragons by Li Yu (reg 961?75), ruler of the Southern Tang period (937?75). Eleven paintings of dragons are attributed to Chen Rong, of which three may be genuine or accurate copies made during the Southern Song period (1127?1279). Nine Dragons Appearing through Clouds and Waves (handscroll, ink with touches of red on paper, 0.46ï¿½10.96 m; Boston, MA, Mus. F.A.) is inscribed by the artist and dated 1244. The dragons are drawn in calligraphic lines that stand out against the background of clouds, rocks and water. Their heads express their power and also betray a certain humour, two attributes of the Dao (?Way?). In contrast to the old-fashioned depiction of triangular scales on the dragons? bodies, the background is expressionistic, executed in varied ink tones produced by rubbing the paper with an ink-soaked cloth. Long, sweeping brushstrokes are used to draw the movements of the clouds and water, while short brushstrokes of dry and wet ink conjure the massive rocks.--DOA"@en .
