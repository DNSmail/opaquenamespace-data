Chinese painter. Although he originally painted in traditional styles, his later work became both more spontaneous in execution and more conceptual, in a manner that can be associated with the southern Chan (Jap. Zen) Buddhist approach to enlightenment (see Buddhism, ?III, 8). Together with Muqi he became one of the best known painters of Chan subjects (see China, ?V, 3(ii)(b)) of the late Southern Song period (1127?1279). According to the Tuhui baojian (?Precious mirror for examining painting?) by Xia Wenyan (preface dated 1365), which is the basic source for all later references, Liang was a follower of Jia Shigu (fl 1130?60), an official from Bianliang (now Kaifeng, Henan Province), who served in the imperial painting academy at Lin?an (now Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province) during the Shaoxing period (1131?61) of the reign of Gaozong (reg 1127?62). Liang was also a member of the Academy and between 1201 and 1204 held the rank of painter in attendance (daizhao). Although he was awarded the jindai (?golden belt?), the highest honour given to members of the Academy, he appears to have subsequently resigned his official position. After leaving the court he went to live in Liutong si, a temple near Lin?an that was a centre of Chan painting. He did not go there for religious reasons but probably in protest against the bureaucracy and mainstream Chinese painting. Whatever the reason, his new painting style was far removed from his earlier Academic conservatism. All of his extant work, with the exception of two possible attributions, is to be found in Japan, where he exerted great influence on Zen painting (see also Japan, ?VI, 4(vii)). Liang Kai?s retirement from official life marked a radical change in his artistic style. His early works are painted in the plain-line drawing (baimiao) traditions of Li gonglin as interpreted by Jia Shigu. His subjects included ghosts and celestial deities as well as Confucian and Daoist themes. An example of Liang?s early style may be seen in the Scholar of the Eastern Fence (Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.), which depicts the great poet Tao Yuanming (ad 365?427) in a conventional setting associated with the compositional techniques of Ma Yuan and Xia Gui. Liang was also proficient in the monumental landscape style of the Northern Song period (960?1279; see China, ?V, 3(iv)(a)). His retreat from the capital marked the introduction of the spontaneous reduced brush (jianbi) technique, which is associated with Chan painting. He studied this new approach with a Chan master Wuzhun (1177?1249), a mediocre painter but a good calligrapher. Liang?s later work reveals a strong calligraphic influence in the total control of the ink tones and the flexibility of the brush. In the brevity and descriptiveness of his brushstrokes he exploits the properties of the ink and the brush to the full. Such brushwork is also related to literati painting traditions. A poem by the Chan monk Beijian (d 1246) relates Liang?s approach to painting: ?Liang Kai treasured his ink as if it were gold. But when he got drunk [the valued drops of ink] could suddenly become a downpour? (Encyclopedia of World Art, ix, p. 240). Such a release of inhibitions through alcohol provides yet another explanation for the radical change in his style. Liang Kai painted with strong brushstrokes, but he also utilized the wet ?boneless? technique (mogu), in which washes of graded ink tones define shape and form without lines, especially in the new genre referred to as pictures of Chan enlightenment (Chan ji tu). His painting of A Sage (Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.) is the only example of such a spontaneous style in the imperial collection. It is an imaginary portrait executed in the ?splashed-ink? (pomo) technique, with scratchy, wet strokes that flow into washes or wet areas in a process that is only partially controlled. The broad washes composing the Sage?s body contrast with the wispy lines that define the facial features. The Nan Song yuan hua lu (?Record of the Southern Song Academy?, 1721), compiled by the poet and scholar Li O (1692?1752), notes that Liang Kai painted with wedge-like strokes (piena). This technique is especially obvious in Huineng, the Sixth Chan Patriarch, Chopping Bamboo at the Moment of Enlightenment (see fig.). Liang Kai painted a variety of traditional Buddhist themes, but none was as specifically connected with the Chan sect as this composition and another entitled Huineng, the Sixth Chan Patriarch, Tearing up a Sutra (Tokyo, T. Mitsui priv. col.), with which it is usually paired. Both paintings were apparently brought to Japan fairly soon after their completion but were later separated. In the first painting, which is largely conceptual in character, space is suggested by a single dry brushstroke that indicates the ground-plane and a fragmented tree trunk that establishes recession in the composition. The angular figure of the patriarch is created through a series of equally angular choplike ?stake- head? (juetou) strokes consistent with the chopping motion of the blade. Washes in graded ink tones give an impression of modelling. The energetic definition of the strong brushstrokes contrasts with the more delicate wispy hair and tightly defined features of the man?s face shown in profile consistent in style with the technique of A Sage. Both personify the Chan (Zen) search for enlightenment through action rather than holy scriptures. In contrast, a fluid line reflects the contemplative mood of another well-known composition, the portrait of the poet Li Bo (Tokyo, N. Mus.). -Grove Art Online"@en .
