Chinese painter, grandson of (1) Xiang Yuanbian. He grew up in cultured surroundings with access to Yuanbian?s collection. Through family connections he knew some of the leading artistic figures of the late Ming period (1368?1664), including the painting theorist Dong Qichang, who was employed as a tutor in the household and later contributed inscriptions to some of Xiang?s paintings. Referring to Zhang Yanyuan?s analysis in Lidai minghua ji (?Record of famous painters of all periods?; completed c. 847) of the first law of painting put forward in the 6th century by Xie He in Gu huapin lu (?Classification of painters?), Dong praised Xiang?s works for expressing the vital movement inherent in things (qiyun or shenyun, ?spirit resonance?), whereby an artist achieves accurate representation. Xiang also knew a number of painters from Songjiang, an art centre near Shanghai, including Chen Jiru. Xiang wrote that in his youth he was forced to paint at night because his father made him study for the official examinations by day, despite the fact that he had no enthusiasm for a career in government affairs. His love of art and his confidence in his ability are suggested by a dream he recorded: ?One night I dreamt that my brush stood up like a pillar more than ten feet tall. I climbed up and occupied the top of it, clapping my hands, laughing and talking. Since then, I have felt as if I were inspired and have often achieved fine results while imitating the works of ancient masters.? However, he not only copied old masterworks but also drew inspiration from nature. In 1645 the Manchus occupied Nanjing, and Xiang Shengmo and his relatives were forced to flee south. Their art collection was largely destroyed and several members of the family committed suicide. Xiang survived and expressed his anguish in poetry and in painting. Jiaxing xian zhi, the local history, records that in his later years he lived a life of poverty along the Fuchun River, selling his paintings to survive. Xiang?s most important work is a series of six landscape handscrolls on the theme of eremetic withdrawal. Traditionally a wise ruler would summon a virtuous recluse to his government, and the recluse would demonstrate the purity of his spirit by declining the invitation or serving only briefly before retreating once more to the wilderness. The earliest of the paintings, Calling the Hermit (1625?6; Los Angeles, CA, Co. Mus. A.), seems strongly influenced by Dong Qichang, whom the artist visited in Songjiang (1625?6), and who had painted a picture on the same theme, Calling the Hermit at Qingxi (handscroll, ink on paper, 1611; Lyme, NH, priv. col., see Cahill, pl. 39). But whereas Dong took pains to play down narrative content or easily readable depictions of nature, Xiang presented the viewer with a long composition that blends fanciful, animated landscape forms with mundane activity: gentlemen fishing, crossing bridges or sitting in thatched houses. Xiang?s scrolls painted after his family?s ruin are shorter, smaller works that required less of his time and were probably more saleable. Chu-tsing Li suggests that the colour red, which appears more often in Xiang?s works after 1645, is a visual allusion to his loyalty to the pre-Manchu Ming rulers whose family name, Zhu, means ?red?. --DOA"@en .
