Tang dynasty (b c. ad 675; d 730). Son of (1) Li Sixun. He was appointed to the position of vice-president of the Right Grand Secretariat of the crown prince, but little else is known of his life. Whether he actually served in the army cannot be confirmed, but he came to be called Xiao Li Jiangjun (Little General Li) to distinguish him from his father, (1) Li Sixun, called Da Li Jiangjun (Great General Li). Later art critics preferred now one, now the other; but it has become impossible to differentiate between the two from the extant copies of their works available for study. Two extant works are usually suggested to be copies of paintings by Li Zhaodao as they have come to be closely identified with his traditions. The Picture of the Winding River (Ch?u Chiang T?u; hanging scroll, colours on silk, h. 1712 mm, w. 1113 mm; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.) is a faithful re- creation of the 8th-century landscape style, with a strongly linear design developed by folded and fissured mountain forms. The more frequently reproduced Emperor Minghuang?s Journey to Shu (Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.; for illustration see ï¿½(1) above) depicts an event that took place in 756, after Li Zhaodao?s death. There are other copies of the same composition, including one in Philadelphia (U. PA Mus.) in both vertical and horizontal format. --DOA"@en .
