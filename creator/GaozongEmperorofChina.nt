Song dynasty (b Bianliang [modern Kaifeng], Henan Province, 1107; reg 1127?62; d Lin?an, now Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, 1187). Chinese calligrapher, art patron and founding emperor of the Southern Song dynasty (1127?1279). He was the ninth son of the Song artist?emperor Huizong and inherited his father?s artistic talent. He played an important role in encouraging the arts, reviving imperial patronage and setting a standard for his royal successors. Gaozong received a thorough classical education, and his artistic interests were not discouraged, for he was not expected ever to rule. When his oldest brother, the Emperor Qinzong (reg 1126?7), was captured by the Jï¿½rchen nomads, founders of the Jin dynasty (1115?1234) in the north, Gaozong took the throne in order to perpetuate the Song dynasty in the south. He rallied support among the literati and the military by bestowing his calligraphic transcriptions of carefully selected texts on specific individuals. His calligraphy enjoyed widespread familiarity and influence after he started distributing rubbings of his works to successful jinshi (civil service examination graduates) in 1135; in the 1140s he had his transcriptions of the Confucian classics engraved on stone tablets. Gaozong particularly excelled in the slightly informal Song kai (Song regular script, also called xing kaishu) and the somewhat archaic zhang caoshu (draft cursive) script. His development as a calligrapher is attested by a series of dated works, as well as by the comments of late 12th- century writers. As a youth he was strongly influenced by the distinctively individual style of Huang tingjian, whose diagonal and horizontal strokes were written with a tremulous brush and strokes of exaggerated length. The influence of Huang?s style is seen in Gaozong?s earliest extant writing, Foding Guangming ta bei (?Stele for the Guangming pagoda?, rubbing, 1133; Tokyo, Imp. Household col.). In the late 1130s, Gaozong changed to the more classically elegant style of Mi Fu (see Mi, (1)), as is seen in his Ci Yue Fei shouchi (?Handwritten order to general Yue Fei?, c. 1138; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.). In the early 1140s, he turned directly to Mi Fu?s own models, the Two Wangs (Wang Xizhi and Wang Xianzhi; see Wang (i), (1) and (2)), and followed their styles for the rest of his life. Most of his extant calligraphy is in this mode, the best- known example being his Huizong wenji xu (?Preface to the collected writings of Huizong?, 1154; Kyoto, Mrs Ogawa priv. col.). Late in life he favoured zhang caoshu script, seen in his transcription of Luoshen fu (?Nymph of the Luo River?, after 1162; Shenyang, Liaoning Prov. Mus.). --DOA"@en .
