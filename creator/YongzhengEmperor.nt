<http://opaquenamespace.org/ns/creator/YongzhengEmperor> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Wei Ran; Buddhist Buildings (Ancient Chinese Architecture series, v.6), English edition, New York: Springer-Verlag Wien, 2000. (??? ? y?ngzhï¿½ngdï¿½) (born Yinzhen (?? ? yï¿½nzh?n) December 13, 1678 - October 8, 1735) was the fourth emperor of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, and the third Qing emperor to rule over China, from 1722 to 1735. A hard-working ruler, Yongzheng's main goal was to create an effective government at minimum expense. Like his father, the Kangxi Emperor, Yongzheng used military force in order to preserve the dynasty's position. Suspected by historians to have usurped the throne, his reign was often called despotic, efficient, and vigorous. Although Yongzheng's reign was much shorter than the reigns of both his father, the Kangxi Emperor, and his son, the Qianlong Emperor, his sudden death was probably brought about by his workload. Yongzheng continued an era of continued peace and prosperity as he cracked down on corruption and waste, and reformed the financial administration. (Wikipedia)"@en .
