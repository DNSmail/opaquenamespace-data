Ming dynasty (b Suzhou, Jiangsu Province; fl c. 1580?1620). Chinese painter. He earned his living by painting both landscapes and figures and was heir to the late Wu school painting tradition. His paintings display an impressive range of styles and subjects from literati themes, as in Gazing Out from a Pavilion in the Mountains (ink and colour on paper; 1618; Tokyo, Seikad? Bunko), to more careful and conservative compositions of figures in landscapes, such as Tao Yuanming Appreciating Chrysanthemums (ink and colour on silk; 1619; Ann Arbor, U. MI, Mus. A.). The former demonstrate a subtle and accomplished handling of brush and ink with minimal use of colour, capturing the naturalistic aspects of mountain scenery. The latter are tightly constructed parodies of inherited conventions. Usually, the composition is divided into three sections from bottom to top with an exaggerated middle ground of water, a practice that dates back to the Yuan period (1279?1368). In the Ann Arbor painting, the water is delineated by the archaic fishnet pattern that originated in the Tang period (ad 618?907). A decorative effect is achieved through the repetition of the waves and the repeated application of twisting hemp-fibre texture strokes ( pima cun) to describe the rock surfaces. The elongated proportions of the scroll and use of attenuated pine trees reflect the influence of Wu School artists Wen Zhengming and Qiu Ying. The painting depicts the famous poet?statesman Tao Yuanming (ad 365?427), who became the archetypal literatus, idealized because he retired early from his government position to pursue his own interests of writing and growing chrysanthemums. The figures are drawn in fine lines and colours with mannered and distorted features and proportions. The heads appear strangely flattened; the figures are portly and humorous. Li?s bizarre figure style influenced his contemporary Sheng Maoye. --DOA"@en .
