Yuan dynasty (b Changshu, Jiangsu Province, 1269; d Changshu, 1354). Chinese painter. He was designated one of the Four Masters of the Yuan, together with Ni zan, Wu zhen and Wang meng. Born into a family named Lu, he was orphaned when very young. The impoverished Lu family had him adopted when he was seven or eight by a Mr Huang of Yongjia, Zhejiang Province, who was living in Changshu at the time. Since Huang was about 90 years old and without male offspring, the names Huang Gongwang and Zijiu were chosen, which together mean ?Mr Huang has desired a son for a long time?. Huang Gongwang received a good education, and some documents suggest that he was a child prodigy. In his youth, he served as a legal clerk in the Office of Surveillance in western Zhejiang Province and was put in charge of matters related to the collection of land taxes for helping poor peasants. In 1315, when he was working in Beijing at the Investigation Bureau of the Office of the Imperial Censor, Zhang Lu, he was imprisoned for alleged involvement in mishandling of land taxes in Zhejiang. A plan to collect taxes that Zhang proposed to the court in fact had been undermined by rich landowners and corrupt officials; later, when Zhang was cleared, Huang was released. As a result of this Huang decided to give up official life, changing his name to Yifeng (?One Peak?). For a time he lived in Huating (modern Songjiang in Shanghai Municipality), making his living as a fortune-teller. About 1329 he joined the Daoist Quanzhen sect. None of Huang?s works on Daoism survive, but the Daozang (Daoist Canon) does include his biography. In 1334 he established a Hall of the Three Doctrines in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province. The Three Doctrines sect, which reached its height in the Yuan period (1279?1368), incorporated elements of Confucianism, Daoism and Chan (Jap. Zen) Buddhism into a syncretic philosophy; Huang?s interest in it suggests the breadth of his philosophical and religious outlook. Huang was also versatile in literature and the arts. One contemporary source states: ?His learning does not rank below anyone. Of all things under heaven there is nothing that he does not know. Even regarding the smallest skill and artistry, he is in good command. He can compose long poems and short verses instantly. He is especially adept in painting. People respect him as a teacher.? Since this source is concerned with dramatists, Huang must have been a writer of plays. He wrote a volume of poetry, Dachi Daoren ji, no longer extant, and was also noted as a flautist. He had many literary and artistic friends, including the painters Ni Zan, Cao Zhibai, Fang Congyi, Yang Weizhen (1296?1370) and Zhang Yu (1277?1348), and the poet Yang Zai; he is said to have been a pupil of the painter Zhao Mengfu. In the Yangzi delta area Huang also lived in Quzhou, Fuyang, and, in his last years, Hangzhou and the Fuchun River area (all in Zhejiang Province). Seventeenth-century sources state that he liked to lose himself in nature, perhaps sitting all day in the mountains or staying close to the sea, watching the waves, wind and rain, or sailing a boat alone on a lake, chanting songs and drinking wine. Some 60 extant paintings are attributed to Huang Gongwang, but only a few are accepted as genuine. Huang is said to have started painting only after the age of 50 (c. 1320), though none of the accepted works dates to before the 1340s. Jiuzhu fengcui (?Nine pearl peaks?; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.), a hanging scroll on satin in ink, though unsigned, has a colophon indicating its dedication to Yang Weizhen and is one of Huang?s earliest works. Many basic forms, such as rocks and trees, are not fully developed. Xishan yuyi (?Rivers and hills before rain?; see fig. 1) has an inscription of 1344 dating it to some years earlier. Elements such as patterns of trees and mountains, contrasts and variations, and freedom of brushwork are further developed. Tianchi shibi (?Stone cliff at the heavenly pond?; 1341; Beijing, Pal. Mus.), a hanging scroll on silk, depicts rocks making up a centralized formation of high mountains, a typical Yuan composition. The most important painting by Huang Gongwang, Fuchun shan ju tu (?Dwelling in the Fuchun mountains?; see fig. 2), represents what came to be considered the most typical aspects of Huang?s personal style. In ink on paper, it depicts broad stretches of the Fuchun River with free, powerful brushwork. Strokes form patterns, rhythms and movements in spontaneous ways associated with calligraphy. Although still representational, the landscape is personalized and abstracted to reflect Huang?s interest in finding freedom of expression in nature, a tradition inherited from the 10th-century painter Dong yuan. The scroll has a complex history. Originally painted for the Daoist Cheng Wuyong, in the 15th century it was acquired by Shen Zhou in Suzhou. Having passed through several hands in that area, in 1596 it came to Dong Qichang in Beijing, who brought it back to his hometown, Huating (Songjiang), where it became very influential among artists. One owner, Wu Hongyu, loved the painting so much that he ordered it to be burnt at his deathbed, and consequently, in 1650, the beginning section was damaged; total destruction was only averted by Wu?s nephew. As a result, the painting exists in two sections: the main section went into the collection of the Qianlong emperor in the 18th century, and the beginning part, after repair, went through many private hands and finally into the Zhejiang Provincial Museum in Hangzhou, where it is entitled Shengshan tu (?The remaining mountains?). Copies of the painting include a scroll identical to the original apart from a missing last section (Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.) that is dated 1338 but was probably made in the middle part of the Ming (1368?1644) period. This version went into the collection of the Qianlong emperor before the original did, and was at first accepted by the emperor and his staff as the genuine one. When the original was in the hands of Dong Qichang and the Wu family, copies were made by many painters, including Cheng Zhengkui, Wang Hui, Wu Li, Yun Xiang (1586?1655), Shen Hao and Zou Zhilin ( fl c. 1610?51). Since the beginning of the 17th century, the scroll has had a great influence on Chinese painting. Huang Gongwang?s treatise on painting, Xie shanshui jue (?Secrets of describing landscape?), was preserved by one of his admirers, Tao Zongyi, in an edition of 1366 (see China, ï¿½V, 3(iv)(b)). In this Huang mentions the prevalence in his time of the Dong Yuan tradition and offers many technical points in painting trees, rocks, mountains, clouds and water, emphasizing the literati tradition. He concludes, ?In doing paintings there are four words that must be absolutely expelled: perversity, prettiness, vulgarity, and derivativeness? (trans. based on Cahill), which became a guiding principle for literati painting. --DOA"@en .
