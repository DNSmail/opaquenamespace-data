Ming dynasty (b Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, 1502; d Suzhou, 1575). Painter, nephew of (1) Wen Zhengming and cousin of (2) Wen Jia. He was renowned for his mean personality: as a youth he lost a legal dispute with his uncle and teacher, Wen Zhengming, and was imprisoned. Like Wen Jia, he failed the provincial juren (second degree) civil service examinations. Perhaps because of his cantankerous character, he did not often participate in Suzhou scholarly gatherings, nor was he as actively involved in Wu school activities as were his cousins Wen Peng (1498?1573) and Wen Jia; his paintings do not usually bear inscriptions by his contemporaries, and colophons by him are rare. The critic Wang Shizhen (1526?90) marvelled at how such a vile person could produce such fine landscapes. Apart from Miniature Portrait of Yang Jijing (handscroll, ink and light colours on paper, 1526; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.), Wen Boren?s paintings are landscapes. He followed the Wen family style, using meticulous brushstrokes and an elongated format for hanging scrolls. The few times he painted in the mode of a master of the Yuan period (1279?1368) he chose Wang meng, whose complex, interweaving rock forms and twisting trees suited Wen Boren?s personality. Dwellings of the Immortals Amid Streams and Mountains (hanging scroll, ink and colour on paper, 1531; Cambridge, priv. col.) represents this style. A serpentine mountain mass is richly textured with numerous trees, rocks, buildings and figures. The deep pastel colours and the use of the archaic fishnet pattern to represent water also refer to Wang Meng?s style. The luxuriant elegance of the painting is, however, derived from Wen Zhengming. The Four Myriads (Siwan tu; four hanging scrolls, ink and colour on paper, 1551; Tokyo, N. Mus.) is considered his masterpiece. The scrolls are extremely dense, full compositions that portray the four seasons with repeated use of bamboo for spring, pines for summer, sunlit waves for autumn and snowy peaks for winter. At other times Wen Boren worked in a sparse style, as in Lute Song: Saying Farewell at Xunyang (short handscroll, ink and light colour on paper; Cleveland, OH, Mus. A.), an illustration of the ?Pipa Xing? (?Lute song?; n.d.) by the poet Bai Juyi (ad 772?846). Water reeds, moon, maple tree and boats on the watery expanse are motifs from the prose poem. A poignant mood is evoked by the spacious composition, precise brushstrokes and soft, pale colours. The water is portrayed with the archaic fishnet pattern that originated in the Tang period (ad 618?907), when the poem was written. River Landscape with Towering Mountains (see fig.) depicts scholars enjoying nature. The tall, narrow proportions and light, feathery brushwork reflect the influence of Wen Zhengming. The composition is divided horizontally into two halves, with a separate spatial system for each half. In the foreground are riverside pavilions, trees and figures viewed from an elevated perspective. In the background, the mountains recede along a zigzag axis. They are treated in a volumetric fashion and topped with pines reminiscent of the Yuan master Huang Gongwang. The branches and foliage of the foreground trees weave together to create an intricate surface design. The contrast and tension between the upper and lower sections bring new life to this traditional theme. The ruler under whom Wen Boren lived, the Jiajing emperor (reg 1522?66), was an avid patron of Daoism and contributed to its increased influence and practice during the 16th century. Like Wen Jia, Wen Boren painted Daoist themes, for example Fanghu (hanging scroll, ink and colour on paper, 1563; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.), a portrayal of one of the Daoist islands of the immortals, and Spring Dawn at Dantai (handscroll, ink and colour on paper, n.d.; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.). -- DOA"@en .
