Yuan dynasty (b Tiantai, Zhejiang Province, 1290; d Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, 1343). Chinese calligrapher, painter, connoisseur and collector. He was appointed connoisseur to the imperial art collection housed at the newly constructed Kuizhang Pavilion in Beijing in 1330, by the Yuan emperor Wenzong (reg 1330?32). He was given the title of Master Connoisseur of Calligraphy, and was responsible for the verification of all the painting and calligraphy that entered the collection. After the death of Wenzong in 1332, Ke retired to Suzhou, where he spent the rest of his life. Ke owned a large collection of painting and calligraphy and was often asked to authenticate works and write inscriptions. His calligraphy appears on paintings such as Lowland with Trees (handscroll, ink on paper, n.d.; New York, John M. Crawford jr priv. col.) attributed to Guo Xi, Early Autumn (handscroll, ink and colour on paper, 267ï¿½1020 mm, n.d.; Detroit, MI, Inst. A.) by Qian Xuan and one of the three genuine Tang copies of Wang Xizhi?s Orchid Pavilion Preface (Lanting xu; ad 353; see China, ï¿½IV, 2(ii)). He knew Yu Ji (1272?1348) and Zhao Mengfu personally; their inscriptions often appear next to his. Ke inscribed many of Zhao?s paintings, among them his Bamboo, Rocks and Lonely Orchids (handscroll, ink on paper, 505ï¿½1442 mm, n.d.; Cleveland, OH, Mus. A). The painting Duck by a Riverbank (hanging scroll, ink and colours on paper, 4.75ï¿½3.57 m, 1301; Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.) by Chen Lin ( fl c. 1300) is accompanied by comments written by Ke, Zhao and Qiu Yuan. Although Ke painted landscapes and ink flowers, he is best known for bamboo, which he modelled after the Song bamboo painter, Wen tong (see China, ï¿½V, 3(vi)). In this subject, too, he sometimes joined with a friend to paint: he collaborated with Ni Zan, for instance, on a painting of ink bamboo at the Beijing Palace Museum. Ke was best known as a calligrapher. He studied the Tang calligrapher Ouyang xun and his son Ouyang Tong (d ad 691), specializing, as they did, in regular (kaishu) and running (xingshu) scripts. Ke?s Palace Poems (n.d.; Princeton U., NJ, A. Mus.) shows the influence of his models, who emphasized the careful articulation of each movement of the brush. Ke appropriated and exaggerated certain mannerisms, such as the leftward curl of the brush on entrance to vertical strokes, and simplified others, as in the corner strokes, in which he tended to remove the shoulder produced by the brush as it turns and rests before coming down at a right angle. He delighted in contrasting thick strokes to others as fine as tendrils, so that the page seems to breathe in a waxing and waning movement. In the inscription to Guo Xi?s Lowland with Trees the calligraphy is less fanciful and more business-like. The same balance of characters and accuracy of technique are retained, but less attention is given to contrast of line, making the flow of characters smooth and purposeful. --DOA"@en .
