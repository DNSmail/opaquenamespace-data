Ming dynasty (b Haiyan, Zhejiang Province; fl c. 1501?21). Chinese painter. He probably began his artistic career as a minor court painter in the latter part of the reign of the Hongzhi emperor (reg 1488?1505); one of his paintings, dated 1501, bears a seal indicating that he had been summoned to court at least by that date. During the reign of the Zhengde emperor (reg 1506?21), when he was most active, he rose to the position of daizhao (?painter in attendance?) at the imperial atelier, the Renzhi dian, and was honoured by the gift of a seal from the emperor, after which he nicknamed himself Yiqiao (?the woodcutter?). Along with some other contemporary court painters, he was considered to belong in a loose sense to the Zhe school. Zhu painted a wide range of subjects, from figures and landscapes to bamboo and birds. His model in the first two genres was the Yuan-period (1279?1368) painter Sheng Mao. In bamboo painting, Xia Chang (1388?1470) served as his source. Zhu?s tenure at court overlapped with that of Lu Ji, who specialized in painting birds and who was Zhu?s model in this genre, possibly also his personal teacher. Zhu?s extant paintings, however, are limited to landscapes. In choosing to follow Sheng Mao and the 11th-century painter Guo Xi, Zhu differed from other court painters, who were uniformly influenced by Ma Yuan. Zhu?s study of these two painters is evident from the large painting Gazing about the Misty River (hanging scroll, ink and colours on silk, h. 1.68 m; Beijing, Pal. Mus.). The first focus is on two scholars and their servant, who gaze out at the scene. An open book beside them suggests they may be reflecting on the Chinese classics or reading poetry. They are sitting on a promontory in the left corner of the painting, framed by surrounding foliage, in particular by a group of trees that reaches above and arcs over them. The first direction of view, which is also that of the gazing gentlemen, extends towards two scenes separated by water, and a final line of mountains. The lower and more open vista contains a hint of unseen territory beyond. The eye is then impelled by the arching branches of the foreground trees upwards into rising peaks. Vignettes and hints of life and habitation are everywhere. Each mountain rise hosts pavilions, each clump of trees shades a house. In the valley, fishermen fish and a scholar wanders home; over the next stretch of water lies a whole fishing village with boats moored in clusters and two junks setting off in full sail. Zhu?s nervous, jagged line is similar to that used by Sheng Mao, as is his skill in carefully describing all the elements in the painting, such as the well-drawn figures and the vine- encrusted trees. On the other hand, the clawlike branches, although much exaggerated by Zhu, and the theatrical surging of the mountain range overhead show an awareness of the techniques of Guo Xi. Very much in the professional as opposed to the literati mode of painting, this is one of Zhu?s most ambitious works. He was also capable of more rapid, abbreviated, literati styles and compositions, as in Solitary Angler on a Wintry River (Tokyo, N. Mus.). --DOA"@en .
