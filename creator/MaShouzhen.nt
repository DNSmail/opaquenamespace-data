Ming dynasty Courtesan in Nanjing, renowned for her beauty, charm and outstanding talent in painting, which began in childhood. Most famous relationship was her lifelong affair with popular poet and calligrpaher Wang Zhideng. Ma's painting specialty was orchids, particularly in the 'double- outline' technique. Her affinity for the flower resulted in taking the name Xianglan ('Xiang River Orchid'). Her painting skill was recognized by her contemporaries and her works were widely collected. --Weidner So many courtesans took up the brush in the late Ming that the period might be regarded as the age of the courtesan in the history of Chinese women painters. Ma Shouzhen shared the stage with such other painting courtesans as Xue Susu ( fl late 16th?mid-17th century), Lin Xue ( fl first half 17th century), Gu Mei (1619?64), Dong Bai (1625?51) and Liu Shi (1618?64). All are known because of their alliances with leading literati. To win upper-class admirers, these women cultivated skills in poetry, calligraphy, painting and music, the same pastimes enjoyed by their clients. With some exceptions, such as Lin Xue, who specialized in landscape, the courtesans generally painted simple floral and plant subjects that could be easily mastered and spontaneously executed for the amusement of a gentleman caller. The orchid, a metaphor for a beauty living in pure seclusion, was a favourite subject. Ma Shouzhen painted orchids in ink, or in ink and light colours, with a delicate touch and calculated refinement.--DOA"@en .
