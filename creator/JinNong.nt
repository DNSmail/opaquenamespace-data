Qing dynasty (b Renhe, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, 1687; d 1764). Chinese painter, calligrapher and poet. He was one of the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou (see Yangzhou school). In his youth he showed promise as a poet, and his talent was appreciated by such leading scholars as Mao Qiling (1623?1716) and Zhu Yizun (1629?1709). His teacher, He Chuo (1661?1722), also praised him as a poet belonging to the tradition of the Tang-period (ad 618? 907) poets Meng Haoran (689?740) and Gu Juang (c. 725?814), and as the best among his peers. Jin became a notable figure in the Nanping shi she (Nanjing Poetry Club), whose members included such distinguished literati figures and artists as Li E (1692?1752), Huang Shijun (1696?1773), Ding Jing (1696?1765) and Chen Zhuan (1668?after 1748). It was at this time that he acquired the reputation of being aloof and difficult??eccentric??which did not, however, prevent him from being known and well received. He was seen frequently among the ï¿½lites of the cultural and artistic centres of Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, and Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province, or of other cities visited during his travels. Except for a brief tenure as a family tutor, he had no paid employment. Instead, unlike the literati amateur painters, who sometimes accepted money privately, he made a living by bartering his writings and paintings. Part of his patronage came from wealthy salt merchants and officials in Yangzhou. When he approached the reigning poet, Yuan Mei, with the hope of broadening his clientele, he was good-naturedly chastised. Precarious though his circumstances often were, he indulged in refined, even sensual pleasures and took in servants known for their artistic and literary talents. A connoisseur of antiques, he amassed a notable collection of inkstones (see China, ï¿½XIII, 13) and thousands of ink rubbings. Jin?s style of calligraphy was inspired by the Han-period (206 bc?ad 220) clerical script (lishu), as seen in the inscription on his painting Bamboo (see fig.). He developed a uniquely bold, innovative style by combining thickened lateral brushstrokes with attenuated vertical or slanted strokes. In this way he attempted to re-create the engraved impression of stelae of the Northern Wei period (ad 386?534; see China, ï¿½IV, 2(vii)). Jin claimed that it was not until 1736 that he began to paint. In that year he declined candidacy for the prestigious boxue hongci (?wide erudition?) examination offered by the Qianlong emperor (reg 1736?96). Nevertheless, he travelled to Beijing and during the journey had the opportunity to study ancient works in various art collections. An album of paintings attributed to Jin Nong (Zurich, Mus. Rietberg) includes his first attempts at landscape painting. The inscriptions show the artist?s predilection for a style of calligraphic inscription on paintings that was so rigid as to be akin to printed forms. The contrast with the fluent strokes and subtle strength seen in his calligraphic works per se is marked. Once embarked, at the age of 50, on his painting career, Jin experimented ceaselessly in a wide range of themes. In his 60s he began to explore the theme of bamboo. He also painted plum blossoms, a subject in which he was influenced by Gao Xiang (1688?1754) and Wang Shishen (1686?1759), and horses, a theme of long standing, but rarely tackled by Jin?s contemporaries except in official court painting and by Qing Feng (1740?95). In Jin?s paintings of Buddhist subjects and in his portraiture, he attempted a novel iconic approach and a distinct mode of characterization. His painting talent lay less in his technical skill than in his archaic and whimsical presentation of unusual imagery. The impact of the paintings, which are accompanied by inscriptions, is sharpened by the juxtaposition of his rigid, blocklike calligraphy and the wistful lyrics in the inscription. Jin produced paintings between the 1730s and 1764 only. Two disciples, Luo ping and Xiang Jun, are recorded as having produced works jointly with him, Luo from 1759 and Xiang from 1761. As a result of their collaborations, authentication of Jin Nong?s later works often involves careful study of the works of Luo Ping and, to a lesser extent, of Xiang Jun. Of the two it was Luo Ping who succeeded the master and who was also designated one of the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou. -- DOA"@en .
