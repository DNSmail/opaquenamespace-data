(b Beijing, 26 Sept 1711; reg 1736?96; d 7 Feb 1799). Chinese emperor, collector and artist. The name Qianlong is, in fact, an imperial reign title, but it is used for the emperor more generally than the alternative, Emperor Gaozong. The Qianlong emperor, fourth emperor of the Qing dynasty (1644?1911) ruled for 60 years, longer than any other emperor in Chinese history apart from Kangxi. Although he stepped down in 1796, he did not in fact relinquish power to his successor, the Jiaqing emperor (reg 1796?1820), until his death three years later. The empire he inherited after the able government of his father and grandfather, the Yongzheng (reg 1723?35) and Kangxi (reg 1662?1722) emperors, was strong and prosperous. By the time of Qianlong?s death, however, the country was suffering from financial strain and an erosion of power, caused by military expansion and the Emperor?s taste for luxury, as well as the corrupt practices instigated by his last chief minister, Heshen (1750?99), which spread to the court and officials. The Emperor is best known to art historians as a collector who amassed the largest collection of art known up to that point in China. Most of his painting and calligraphy, collected before 1793, is catalogued in three issues of the Shiqu baoji; all of it bears seal impressions, taken from more than 220 seals, many very large and conspicuous, in the collection. Seal imprints were accompanied by inscriptions in the Emperor?s hand, estimated to number in the tens of thousands. Qianlong was determined to incorporate everything of importance in his collection, and rather than purchasing items he either confiscated them as an imperial right or exerted pressure to encourage them to reach him as gifts or tribute. His passion for collecting extended to porcelain, bronzes, jades, writing implements and rare books. The concentration of so many works in the Emperor?s hands meant that, apart from the priveleged few, artists lost access to important early paintings, formerly scattered among the collections of fellow scholars and friends. The Chinese landscape painting tradition, which relied on the inspiration received and the imaginative re-creation suggested by the old masters, was dealt a fatal blow. For example instead of working directly from Wang Meng?s paintings, artists were forced to interpret the Wang Meng style through later painters. Finally, landscape painting lost all its vitality and was replaced by other genres. Removing painting as an artistic outlet for scholars had the side-effect of increasing the importance of calligraphy as an artistic diversion and was thus perhaps indirectly responsible for the intense interest taken in new models and the rise of the Northern stele school, which reached its height under the Jiaqing and Daoguang (reg 1821?50) emperors (see China, ï¿½IV, 2(vii)(b) and (c)). Qianlong had a fascination for things European, and a group of Europeans, headed by the Italian Jesuit giuseppe Castiglione became prominent at his court. They served primarily as architects, best known for buildings in a combination Rococo?Chinese style, constructed at the Yuanming yuan (known as the Old Summer Palace) outside Beijing, where the Emperor spent an increasing amount of time (see Beijing, ï¿½2 and fig. 1). Castiglione, a favourite of the Emperor, directed immense projects, such as the pictorial recording of the imperial campaigns, and painted likenesses of the Emperor?s preferred horses, pets and courtiers. Qianlong delighted in European gadgets, from toys to telescopes, and the Europeans were responsible for procuring these objects, instructing the Emperor in their use and keeping them repaired. Qianlong was a calligrapher of the Copybook (tie) school, as were his forebears, and he assiduously studied the works of Wang Xizhi, Zhao Mengfu, Wen Zhengming and Dong Qichang. His reign was famous for great calligraphers trained in traditional copybook models, including Liu Yong, Zhang Zhao (1691?1795) and Wang Wenzhi (1730?1802). The Emperor was prolific in his inscriptions and relied on others, including probably Zhung Zhao, to imitate his hand anonymously. His calligraphy cannot be considered as art: it is uniformly uninflected, though at least, unlike his painting, consistent, practised and smooth. Qianlong recorded that he began to study bird-and-flower painting in his collection and to paint when he was 19; he noted as his models the artists Xu Xi and Huang Quan, among others. The Emperor?s name came to be associated with paintings in every genre, as attested by one edition of the Shigu baoji (1745) mentioning over a thousand titles. However, most of the more skilful, detailed and coloured works contain little of his own brushwork and are products of court painters. A monochrome flower painting (1759; Princeton, U., NJ, A. Mus.) exemplifies the Emperor?s painting abilities. Directed by a court painter?s faint underdrawing in charcoal, the Emperor?s rendering of eight different kinds of flower is halting. The weak lines and flat, insipid brushwork, devoid of life, create a string of sad, wilted images. The calligraphy of his verse, appended to each flower, is in comparison stronger. Despite his indifferent talent, Qianlong continued to paint every day, as part of an invariable routine, until his death. --DOA"@en .
