Ming dynasty (b She xian, Anhui Province, 1575; d 1629). Chinese painter and poet. His family moved to Jiading, now part of Shanghai, where he spent most of his life. Li received his juren degree in 1606 and twice attempted the higher examinations, failing the first and arriving late for the second, which disqualified him. Having the means, he chose to abandon pursuit of a government career to lead a cultured life of leisure. He built a house and garden in Nanxiang, near Jiading, called Tan yuan (Sandalwood Garden) after the sandalwood trees that grew there, using the garden?s name thereafter as one of his hao names. He is classed, along with Tang Shisheng (1551?1636), Lou Jian (d 1631) and Cheng Jiasu (1565?1644), as one of the Four Gentlemen of Jiading. All were well-known poets, and Li and Cheng were painters. Li is not known as a calligrapher, although he had an adequately trained hand in a style based on that of Su Shi. In seal-carving, contemporaries praised him as the rival of He Shen ( fl c. 1573?1620). However, while He Shen turned to Han-period (206 bc?ad 220) seals as models (see China, ï¿½XIII, 24), carving intaglio and deliberately wrecking surfaces to give an antique flavour, Li typically carved in relief, in the more conservative style used by Zhao Mengfu of the 13th and 14th centuries and Wen Peng of the 16th. Li also enjoyed carving bamboo. In painting Li is best known as a landscapist. Almost 100 of his works are recorded, and his dated paintings, according to Guo Weichu (1908?71), range from 1614 to 1628. His acknowledged model was the Yuan (1279?1368) master Wu zhen. One landscape, Thin Forest and Distant Mountains (Cleveland, OH, Mus. A.), is typical of his style. Although, like Wu Zhen, Li favoured a brush loaded with wet wash, his schematic composition, with its abbreviation and repetition of elements, was far closer to the work of Dong Qichang, the most influential painter of the period. In a vertical format, a few meagre trees, rooted in a small island of rocks, stretch up over the expanse of water behind to overlap a distant mountain. The viewer?s gaze is drawn straight up the picture. Black dabs of ink in the foreground foliage, repeated on the surface of the mountain, reinforce the vertical line. The result is a compact, tightly knit work. Although Li?s paintings had a limited range of style and composition and lacked the weight and intricacy of line and texture found in artists of greater talent, he was capable of producing work of fresh, nonchalant elegance. His son, Li Hangzhi (d 1644), painted in a similar style. --DOA"@en .
