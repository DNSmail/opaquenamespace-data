Qing dynasty (b Taicang, Jiangsu Province, 1642; d 1715). Painter, art theorist and official, grandson of (1) Wang Shimin. Through Wang Shimin he inherited the teachings of the latter?s tutor, the late Ming-period (1368?1644) painter Dong qichang. Wang thus represented the culmination of a lineage of landscape painting, loosely corresponding to the literati tradition (see China, ï¿½V, 4(ii)), that stretched back to the 8th-century ad painter and poet Wang Wei. Wang achieved eminence in his official career, becoming a district magistrate and a censor and, in 1712, rising to the rank of Vice-president of the Board of Revenue. He became a member of the Hanlin Academy, the highest in the hierarchy of intellectual institutions centred on the court. He was in the service of the Kangxi emperor (reg 1662?1722), to whom in 1700 he became adviser on the imperial art collection. His impact on the art world of the early Qing period (1644?1911) therefore went beyond the products of his brush. He was a prolific editor and theorist: from c. 1705 he was editor-in-chief of the Peiwen zhai shuhuapu, the calligraphy and painting manual of the Peiwen (Kangxi experor?s) studio (published 1708), a massive compilation of excerpts from texts; he also wrote the theoretical essay Yuchuang manbi (?Scattered notes at a rainy window?), the most comprehensive expression of the principles and working methods of the Orthodox school. Wang was equally successful as a painter and dominated the court academy during his later years. Wang Yuanqi was artistically precocious. His grandfather is reported to have observed, on seeing one of Wang?s youthful works, that the boy would surely surpass him and that he had grasped not only the form (style) of the great Yuan-period (1279?1368) landscape painter Huang gongwang but also his spirit. Wang drew artistic inspiration from the works of Huang and of Dong Qichang, both of whom he regarded as significant figures in the revival and transmission of literati ideals, in so far as they had transformed the styles of the Northern Song (960?1127) landscape painters Dong Yuan and Juran. In his own work Wang confined himself almost entirely to landscape studies, usually without figures (see fig.). Details such as buildings and bridges were reduced to a minimum and conventionalized. While stylistic development can be traced in his work, his typical compositions, usually depicting hills rising above a river with trees and houses on the shore, remained constant. Underpinning his landscapes were his theories of painting as set out in the Yuchuang manbi. The artist should begin with an inspiration, purging himself of ?trite feelings? and imagining the general composition before applying the brush. He must establish proportions, foreground and distance, dense and sparse areas and basic tonal values well in advance of the details. The painter?s purpose is not to create beautiful scenery nor to reproduce old compositions precisely, rather it is to capture the qishi (?dynamic force? or ?spirit-momentum?, a term originally associated with calligraphy criticism; see China, ï¿½IV, 3), transferring the concept of kinetic energy inherent in calligraphy to the larger problems of pictorial composition. Wang used the term longmo (?dragon vein?) to express the principal dynamic structure within a landscape. In the 17th century longmo referred to dragon-like (Chin. long) or serpentine compositional movements, built up with individual brushstrokes and connected by ?arteries? (mo) within these larger movements. The composition contained passages that ?opened and closed? (kaihe) and ?rose and fell? (qifu). The former clearly depicted open spaces, such as a long valley closed off at one end by a large and distant mountain; the latter could refer to a succession of hills or boulders, arranged one behind the other, the contours of which could be seen to rise and fall. The clear articulation of all these elements was the essence of a good painting. Wang believed that the painter, having mastered these principles, was capable of a creative synthesis, borrowing from the compositions of past masters but renewing and refreshing their ideas and methods. This insistence on individual creativity moved him beyond the more imitative antiquarian interests of Wang Shimin and Wang Jian, and closer to Dong Qichang?s concern with ?encountering the spirit? of earlier masters. One of his best-known landscapes is Wangchuan Villa, based on an engraving of 1617 of a legendary Wang Wei composition. The scene represented the quintessential domain of the scholar?recluse. Since only copies and popular ink rubbings from stone engravings of the 8th-century composition existed, Wang was free to improvise, using Wang Wei?s poems as a further source of inspiration. As he pointed out, the picture was more than a ?physical likeness by a professional painter?. The detail illustrated preserves the general appearance of the engraving, particularly the tilt of the ground-plane and the disposition of trees and hills. However, Wang created a sharp contrast between empty expanses of water and plain and the vigorously outlined and textured rock forms. The interplay between dense and open areas creates a formal rhythm that continues simultaneously back into the distance and across the picture plane. Wang?s debt to Huang Gongwang is apparent in the rounded rocks piled one against the other in receding, roughly triangular configurations, and in the dry, wiry texture strokes (cun) defining the edges of the mountains. Intermittent cool tones for washes and dots recall the archaic Blue-and-green manner of the Tang period (ad 618? 907). These are combined in places with warmer hues so that two distinct colour schemes emerge: the ?cool? manner of the Tang period and the ?warm?cool? idiom popular with literati painters from the Yuan period onwards. In his ability to work with limited conventional means, while remaining consistently original, Wang?s artistic contribution represents both a summation of Orthodox theory and an escape from the occasional banality of its adherents. Wang Yuanqi collaborated with other artists such as Daoji (e.g. Bamboo in Wind, 1691, Taipei, N. Pal. Mus.) and had many followers, mostly in the court academy and among court officials; an exception was Huang Ding (1660?1730), who worked outside court circles. --DOA"@en .
